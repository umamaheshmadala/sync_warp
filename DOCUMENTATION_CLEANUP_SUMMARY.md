## 🧹 Maintenance Recommendations

### Daily/Weekly
- ✅ Keep root directory clean (only 3 markdown files)
- ✅ Move completion reports to `/docs/completed/` immediately
- ✅ Update `EPIC_STATUS.md` when stories complete

### Monthly
- ✅ Review `/docs/completed/` and archive old docs
- ✅ Update `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` with current status
- ✅ Clean up any temporary files in root

### Quarterly
- ✅ Major archive cleanup - move completed docs to archive
- ✅ Update `docs/archive/README.md` with new content
- ✅ Review and consolidate guides if needed
- ✅ Check for and remove duplicate documentation

### Best Practices Going Forward

1. **One Truth Per Topic**: Never have multiple docs covering the same current info
2. **Archive Completed Work**: Move finished docs to `/docs/completed/` or `/docs/archive/`
3. **Update Epic Status**: Keep `EPIC_STATUS.md` as the single source of truth for progress
4. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent filenames
5. **No Root Clutter**: Keep root directory minimal (README, QUICK_START, WARP only)
