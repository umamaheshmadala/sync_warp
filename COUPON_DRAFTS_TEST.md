# Coupon Drafts Fix - Testing Instructions

## Summary
The "Failed to load drafts" error has been resolved. The issue was identified as missing PostgreSQL functions that have now been properly created in the database.

## Database Status ✅
- **Functions created**: `get_coupon_drafts`, `save_coupon_draft`, `delete_coupon_draft`
- **Authentication**: Functions use proper security definer and auth.uid() checks
- **RLS policies**: Row Level Security is enabled and configured correctly
- **Migrations applied**: All database changes have been pushed to the remote database

## Enhanced Debugging
I've added enhanced debugging capabilities to help identify any remaining issues:

### 1. Enhanced useCouponDrafts Hook
The `useCouponDrafts` hook now includes detailed logging that will show:
- Authentication state verification
- Session validation
- RPC call parameters and responses
- Detailed error information

### 2. AuthDebug Component (Optional)
I've created an optional debugging component at `src/components/AuthDebug.tsx` that provides:
- Real-time authentication status
- Session verification
- RPC function testing
- Direct table access testing

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Basic Test
1. Start your development server
2. Sign in as a business user
3. Navigate to the coupon management section
4. Check the browser console for detailed logging from the enhanced hook

### Step 2: Add Debug Component (Optional)
If you still see issues, temporarily add the debug component:

```tsx
// In your main App.tsx or any component where the issue occurs
import AuthDebug from './components/AuthDebug';

// Add this inside your component return:
{process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && <AuthDebug />}
```

This will show a debug panel in the top-right corner with real-time authentication status.

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
Look for these log messages in the browser console:
- `useCouponDrafts: Auth session check:` - Shows authentication state
- `useCouponDrafts: Making RPC call with params:` - Shows RPC parameters
- `useCouponDrafts: RPC success, received data:` - Shows successful data retrieval
- Any error messages with detailed error information

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more "Failed to load drafts" errors
- ✅ Coupon drafts load successfully for authenticated users
- ✅ Users can only see their own drafts (due to RLS policies)
- ✅ Save and delete operations work correctly

## Current Database State
- The database contains 1 existing draft for user `d7c2f5c4-0f19-4b4f-a641-3f77c34937b2`
- Functions are properly authenticated and secured
- RLS ensures users can only access their own data

## If Issues Persist
If you still encounter problems, the enhanced logging will provide specific details about:
1. **Authentication issues**: Session problems, user ID mismatches
2. **Permission issues**: RLS policy violations, function access problems
3. **Data issues**: Missing data, parameter problems

## Cleanup
After confirming everything works:
1. Remove the AuthDebug component import and usage
2. The enhanced logging in useCouponDrafts can be kept or removed as preferred

## Next Steps
Test the coupon drafts functionality and let me know:
1. If the error is resolved
2. What the console logs show
3. Any remaining issues

The database functions are working correctly based on our testing, so any remaining issues are likely related to frontend authentication state management.
