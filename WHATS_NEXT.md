## 🚀 Next Up: Epic 5 - Social Features

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migrations ⚡ HIGH PRIORITY

**Why:** Rate limiting won't work until the database tables exist

**Action:**
```bash
# 1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
# 2. Navigate to SQL Editor
# 3. Copy and paste the migration file
# 4. Execute the migration
```

**Files to run:**
1. `supabase/migrations/20250130_add_rate_limiting.sql` - ⚡ CRITICAL
2. `supabase/migrations/20250130_add_coupon_analytics.sql` - Optional

**Verification Checklist:**
```sql
-- Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('rate_limit_configs', 'rate_limit_logs');

-- Check RPC functions exist
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name IN ('check_rate_limit', 'record_rate_limit_request');

-- Check default config
SELECT * FROM rate_limit_configs WHERE endpoint = 'coupons/create';
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 2 tables created
- ✅ 3 RPC functions created
- ✅ Default config for 'coupons/create' exists

---

### Step 2: Test Locally 🧪 

**Why:** Verify everything works before deploying to staging

**Action:**
```bash
# 1. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 2. Run tests
npm test

# 3. Test build
npm run build
```

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

#### Test Rate Limiting:
1. [ ] Navigate to coupon creation page
2. [ ] Try to create 5+ coupons rapidly
3. [ ] Verify rate limit banner appears
4. [ ] Check reset time is displayed
5. [ ] Wait for reset and verify access restored

#### Test Error Boundaries:
1. [ ] Navigate through the app
2. [ ] Check console for errors
3. [ ] Verify no crashes occur
4. [ ] Try edge cases (invalid inputs, etc.)

#### Test Core Features:
1. [ ] User login/logout
2. [ ] Business registration
3. [ ] Coupon creation
4. [ ] Search functionality
5. [ ] Check-in features

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Rate limiting works
- ✅ No critical errors

---

### Step 3: Deploy to Staging 🎯

**Why:** Test in production-like environment before going live

**Action:**
```bash
# 1. Build production bundle
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to staging environment
# (Method depends on your hosting - Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

# Example for Vercel:
vercel --prod

# Example for Netlify:
netlify deploy --prod
```

**Post-Deployment Checklist:**
1. [ ] Application loads without errors
2. [ ] Rate limiting works on staging
3. [ ] Error boundaries catch errors
4. [ ] All features functional
5. [ ] Console shows no critical errors
6. [ ] Database connections working

---

### Step 4: Monitor & Gather Feedback 📊

**Why:** Catch any issues early and validate improvements

**Action:**
1. Monitor Supabase logs for rate limit activity
2. Check error boundary activations
3. Monitor application performance
4. Gather user feedback (if applicable)

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Rate limiting activating appropriately
- ✅ No excessive rate limit blocks
- ✅ Error boundaries catching issues
- ✅ No new crashes or errors
- ⚠️ Any unexpected behavior

**Tools:**
- Supabase Dashboard → Logs
- Browser DevTools → Console
- Application performance metrics
