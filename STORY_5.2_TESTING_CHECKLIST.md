## Known Issues / Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Items Requiring Attention:

2. **Photo Upload**: Story mentions photo uploads, but UI component may not have this feature yet
3. **Tags System**: Review tags mentioned in schema, but UI may not support tag selection yet

---

## Database Verification Commands

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify data:

```sql
-- Check if review tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('business_reviews', 'business_review_responses');

-- Check review count for a specific business
SELECT 
  business_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_reviews,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE recommendation = true) as recommendations,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE recommendation = false) as not_recommended
FROM business_reviews
WHERE business_id = 'YOUR_BUSINESS_ID_HERE'
GROUP BY business_id;

-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('business_reviews', 'business_review_responses');

-- View all RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies
