touch src/components/[feature-name]/index.ts

# Plan database needs (if any)
# Check: supabase/migrations/ for existing tables
```

#### **2. Component Development (2-4 days)**
```bash
# TypeScript interfaces
interface [Feature]Data { ... }

# React components with proper typing  
const [Feature]Component: React.FC = () => { ... }

# Custom hooks for data management
const use[Feature] = () => { ... }
```

#### **3. Integration (1 day)**
```bash
# Add routes to src/router/Router.tsx
# Add navigation links to Dashboard
# Update documentation in docs/
```

#### **4. Testing (1 day)**
```bash
# Manual testing of all features
