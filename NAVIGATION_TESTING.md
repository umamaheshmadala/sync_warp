- **Features**:
  - User-friendly 404 error page
  - Navigation suggestions
  - Search functionality integration

### 6. URL State Management
- **File**: `src/utils/urlState.ts`
- **Features**:
  - `useUrlState` hook for query parameter management
  - `useNavigationState` for navigation with state
  - Search state management with debouncing
  - Form state synchronization with URLs

## üß™ Manual Testing Plan

### Test 1: Basic Route Navigation
**Routes to test:**
1. `/` (Landing page)
2. `/auth/login` (Login page)
3. `/auth/signup` (Sign up page)
4. `/dashboard` (Protected - requires auth)
5. `/onboarding` (Protected - requires auth)
6. `/search` (Protected - lazy loaded)
7. `/profile` (Protected - lazy loaded)
8. `/settings` (Protected - lazy loaded)
9. `/nonexistent` (Should show 404)

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Each route loads the correct component
- [ ] Page titles update in browser tab
- [ ] Page transitions are smooth
- [ ] Loading spinners appear for lazy-loaded components
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated

### Test 2: Page Transitions
**Test different transition types:**
1. **Default transitions** (fade):
   - Navigate from Landing ‚Üí Login
   - Navigate between Dashboard pages
   
2. **Auth page transitions** (slide from right):
   - Navigate Login ‚Üî SignUp
   - Navigate from any page to auth pages
   
3. **Modal-like transitions** (scale + fade):
   - Navigate to Profile from Dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings from Profile
   - Navigate to Onboarding

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Smooth animation entrance/exit
- [ ] No visual glitches or jumping
- [ ] Animation timing feels natural
- [ ] Transitions work in both directions

### Test 3: Authentication Flow
**Authentication scenarios:**
1. **Unauthenticated user:**
   - Try accessing `/dashboard` ‚Üí Should redirect to `/auth/login`
   - Try accessing `/profile` ‚Üí Should redirect to `/auth/login`
   - Access `/auth/login` ‚Üí Should load login page
   
2. **Authenticated user:**
   - Access `/auth/login` ‚Üí Should redirect to `/dashboard`
   - Access protected routes ‚Üí Should load normally

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Proper redirect behavior
- [ ] Loading states during auth checks
- [ ] No infinite redirect loops
- [ ] Authentication state persistence

### Test 4: URL State Management
**Test URL parameter handling:**
1. Navigate to search with query: `/search?q=pizza`
2. Modify URL parameters manually
3. Use browser back/forward buttons
4. Refresh page with parameters

**What to verify:**
- [ ] URL parameters are preserved
- [ ] State syncs with URL changes
- [ ] Browser navigation works correctly
- [ ] Page refresh maintains state

### Test 5: 404 Error Handling
**Test invalid routes:**
1. Navigate to `/invalid-route`
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/nonexistent`
3. Try accessing deleted or moved routes

**What to verify:**
- [ ] 404 page loads correctly
- [ ] Helpful navigation suggestions appear
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] User can return to valid routes easily

### Test 6: Performance & Loading
**Test lazy loading and performance:**
1. Open Network tab in DevTools
2. Navigate between pages
3. Check bundle splitting and loading

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Components load only when needed
- [ ] Appropriate loading states shown
- [ ] No unnecessary network requests
- [ ] Fast navigation between cached routes

## üîß Development Testing Routes

### Debug Routes (Development Only)
Available at:
- `/debug/signup` - SignUp component debugging
- `/debug/auth` - Authentication store testing

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Debug routes only available in development
- [ ] Debug routes hidden in production build

## üéØ Key Testing Commands

### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Server starts at: http://localhost:5174/

### Build Production Version
```bash
npm run build
```
- Check for build errors
- Verify production optimizations

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```
- Test production build locally

## üêõ Common Issues to Watch For

### Navigation Issues
- Infinite redirect loops
- Missing route definitions
- Incorrect path parameters
- Authentication check failures

### Animation Issues
- Jerky or delayed transitions
- Components mounting/unmounting incorrectly
- Z-index layering problems
- Animation timing inconsistencies

### Performance Issues
- Slow route transitions
- Large bundle sizes
- Memory leaks from animations
- Unnecessary re-renders

### URL State Issues
- Parameters not syncing
- Browser back/forward breaking
- State loss on page refresh
- Query parameter encoding problems

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The navigation system passes testing when:

1. **All routes load correctly** without errors
2. **Authentication protection** works as expected
3. **Page transitions** are smooth and consistent
4. **URL state management** maintains state correctly
5. **404 handling** provides good user experience
6. **Performance** meets expectations (fast loading)
7. **Mobile responsiveness** works on all screen sizes
8. **Browser compatibility** across modern browsers
