## 📊 Problem Statement

### Initial Assessment:
Story 5.2 components were **60% complete** but **0% integrated**. The review system existed as isolated components with no access points for users.

### Critical Issues Found:
1. ❌ No Reviews tab in BusinessProfile
2. ❌ BusinessReviews component never rendered
3. ❌ No "Write Review" button anywhere
4. ❌ /businesses route returned 404
5. ❌ Review functionality completely inaccessible

---

## 🛠️ Changes Implemented

### 1. BusinessProfile Component Integration

**File:** `src/components/business/BusinessProfile.tsx`

#### Changes Made:

**A. Added Import Statement**
```typescript
// Line 31
import BusinessReviews from '../reviews/BusinessReviews';
```

**B. Updated Tabs Array**
```typescript
// Lines 987-990
const tabs = [
  { id: 'overview', label: 'Overview', count: null },
  { id: 'reviews', label: 'Reviews', count: business?.total_reviews || 0 },
  { id: 'statistics', label: 'Statistics', count: business?.total_reviews || 0 }
];
```

**C. Added renderReviews Function**
```typescript
// Lines 957-964
const renderReviews = () => (
  <BusinessReviews
    businessId={businessId!}
    businessName={business?.business_name || ''}
    isOwner={isOwner}
  />
);
```

**D. Updated Tab Rendering Logic**
```typescript
// Lines 1127-1129
{activeTab === 'overview' && renderOverview()}
{activeTab === 'reviews' && renderReviews()}
{activeTab === 'statistics' && renderStatistics()}
```

---

### 2. Route Configuration

**File:** `src/router/Router.tsx`

#### Changes Made:

**Added /businesses Route**
```typescript
// Lines 135-141
{
  path: '/businesses',
  element: <Suspense fallback={<div className="flex justify-center items-center min-h-screen"><div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-32 w-32 border-b-2 border-indigo-600"></div></div>}><BusinessDiscoveryPage /></Suspense>,
  protected: true,
  title: 'Browse Businesses - SynC',
  description: 'Browse and discover local businesses near you'
},
```

**Rationale:**
- Reused existing `BusinessDiscoveryPage` component (no need to create new page)
- Route is protected (requires authentication)
- Provides public-facing business browsing experience

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well:
1. ✅ Existing components were well-built and complete
2. ✅ Database schema was comprehensive and production-ready
3. ✅ Integration was straightforward (minimal code changes)
4. ✅ Reused BusinessDiscoveryPage instead of creating new component

### Challenges Encountered:
1. ⚠️ Components were in different directory than expected
