## Recommendation

**Phase 1 is COMPLETE enough to commit.** 

The critical security and stability fixes are implemented:
1. ✅ No more mock data in production code
2. ✅ Rate limiting prevents API abuse
3. ✅ Error boundaries provide graceful failure
4. ✅ Test infrastructure ready for expansion

**Test coverage** at 20% foundation is acceptable for Phase 1 because:
- Critical rate limiting is fully tested (100%)
- Test infrastructure is complete
- Test expansion is clearly planned for Phase 2
- We're not blocking on full coverage for initial deployment

**We should commit now** and proceed with Phase 2 test expansion as a separate effort.

## Next Steps After Commit

1. **Deploy to staging** - Verify all Phase 1 features work
2. **Manual testing** - Test rate limiting and error boundaries
3. **Monitor metrics** - Check error rates and performance
4. **Start Phase 2** - Begin test coverage expansion
5. **Plan Phase 3** - Schedule performance improvements
