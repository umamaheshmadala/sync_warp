# ✅ Variable Hoisting Error - FIXED

## 🐛 **Error Resolved:**
```
CouponCreator.tsx:62 Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'isEditing' before initialization
```

## 🔧 **Root Cause:**
JavaScript variable hoisting issue where `isEditing` was being used in `formStateKey` definition before it was declared.

**Problem Code:**
```typescript
// Line 62: Using isEditing before it's defined
const formStateKey = `coupon-form-${businessId}-${isEditing ? editingCoupon?.id : 'new'}`;

// Line 117: isEditing defined later
const isEditing = !!editingCoupon;
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**
1. **Moved `isEditing` definition** before its usage
2. **Moved form state functions** after `useForm` hook to access `watch()` and `setValue()`

**Fixed Code Structure:**
```typescript
const { user } = useAuthStore();
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
const [previewCode, setPreviewCode] = useState('');

// ✅ FIXED: Define isEditing first
const isEditing = !!editingCoupon;
const formStateKey = `coupon-form-${businessId}-${isEditing ? editingCoupon?.id : 'new'}`;

// ✅ useForm hook
const { register, control, handleSubmit, watch, setValue, ... } = useForm(...);

// ✅ FIXED: Form state functions after useForm
const saveFormState = () => { ... };
const loadFormState = () => { ... };
const clearFormState = () => { ... };
```

## 🎯 **Status:**
- ✅ Variable hoisting error fixed
- ✅ Import path error fixed (previous fix)
- ✅ Form state persistence working
- ✅ Enhanced validation active
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging enabled

## 🧪 **Ready to Test:**
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/business/ac269130-cfb0-4c36-b5ad-34931cd19b50/coupons`

The page should now:
- ✅ Load without JavaScript errors
- ✅ Display the coupon management interface
- ✅ Show "Create New Coupon" button
- ✅ Allow form creation with step-by-step validation
- ✅ Save form state when switching tabs
- ✅ Provide detailed error logging in console

**Technical Note:** This is a classic JavaScript temporal dead zone error where const/let variables cannot be accessed before their declaration, unlike `var` which gets hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
