# Coupon Issues - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Summary

All 6 coupon-related issues have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing.

## Issues Fixed

### âœ… Issue 1: Collect Button State Not Matching
**Problem:** The collect button state on the search page didn't reflect actual collection status.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `refreshCollectionState()` function in `useSearch.ts` that queries the database for current collection state
- Modified coupon fetching to only check active collections (`status = 'active'`)
- Updated `handleCollectCoupon` to refresh state after collection

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useSearch.ts` (lines 315-330, 487-518, 664-720)

### âœ… Issue 2: "Failed to Collect Coupon" Error
**Problem:** Collecting coupons from search page threw errors.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Wrapped collection logic in proper try-catch blocks
- Added user authentication checks
- Provided clear error messages via toast notifications
- Fixed the collectCoupon function signature to match expected parameters

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useSearch.ts` (lines 698-720)

### âœ… Issue 3: Wallet Coupon Overflow
**Problem:** Coupons in wallet overflowed their boundaries, not showing all elements.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed `w-full max-w-full` constraint causing overflow
- Fixed title to use `line-clamp-2` and proper flexbox
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to delete button
- Changed grid layout from `auto-rows-fr` to standard responsive grid
- Updated action buttons to use `gap-2 flex-wrap`
- Changed content padding from `w-full overflow-hidden` to `space-y-3`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/user/CouponWallet.tsx` (lines 380, 440-456, 510-511, 800-807)

### âœ… Issue 4: Deleted Coupons Don't Reactivate Collect Button
**Problem:** After deleting a coupon from wallet, users couldn't re-collect it.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed deletion from hard delete to soft delete using status = 'deleted'
- Added `deleted_at` timestamp field
- Modified collection check to only look for active status
- Added cache invalidation after deletion

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useCoupons.ts` (lines 721-745)
- `src/services/couponService.ts` (lines 586-602)

### âœ… Issue 5: Shared Coupons Should Prevent Re-collection
**Problem:** Shared coupons could be collected again by the sender.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `has_been_shared` boolean flag tracking
- Added `shared_to_user_id` to track recipient
- Updated collection check to verify if coupon was shared
- Returns specific error message for shared coupons

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/couponService.ts` (lines 586-602)
- `supabase/migrations/20250203_add_coupon_sharing_tracking.sql` (new file)

### âœ… Issue 6: Missing Coupon Details Modal
**Problem:** No way to view full coupon details including T&C, validity, description.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created comprehensive `CouponDetailsModal` component with:
  - Full coupon information display
  - Terms & conditions section
  - Validity period display
  - Business information
  - Coupon code with copy functionality
  - Collect/Share action buttons
  - Beautiful gradient design
  - Mobile responsive
  - Escape key to close
- Integrated modal in Search page
- Integrated modal in Wallet page

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/modals/CouponDetailsModal.tsx` (436 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Search.tsx` (added modal integration)
- `src/components/user/CouponWallet.tsx` (added modal integration)

## Database Changes

### New Migration: `20250203_add_coupon_sharing_tracking.sql`

**Columns Added:**
- `has_been_shared` (BOOLEAN, default FALSE) - Tracks if coupon was shared
- `deleted_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Soft delete timestamp
- `shared_to_user_id` (UUID) - Foreign key to profiles table

**Indexes Created:**
- `idx_user_coupon_collections_has_been_shared` - Performance optimization
- `idx_user_coupon_collections_deleted_at` - Filter deleted coupons

**Triggers Added:**
- `trigger_set_has_been_shared` - Automatically sets flag when coupon is shared

**RLS Policies Updated:**
- Enhanced SELECT policy to include shared coupons
- Maintained security for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
