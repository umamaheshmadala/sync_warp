# ContactsSidebar Testing Guide

## 🎯 What We're Testing

The ContactsSidebar has been successfully integrated into your business dashboard. We need to test:
1. **Access to Business Dashboard** - Can we reach `/business/dashboard`?
2. **Friends Button Visibility** - Is the Users icon visible in the header?
3. **Sidebar Functionality** - Does clicking open the ContactsSidebar?
4. **Authentication Flow** - Does it work with proper login?

## 🚀 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start the Application
```powershell
# Check if dev server is running
Get-Process -Name *node* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# If not running, start it
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Browser and Navigate
1. Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 3: Authentication Testing

#### Option A: Test with Existing Account
1. If you have an existing account, click **Login**
2. Enter your credentials
3. After login, navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/business/dashboard`

#### Option B: Create Test Account
1. Click **Sign Up**
2. Create a test account with:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `testpassword123`
   - Fill in required profile information
3. Complete onboarding if required
4. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/business/dashboard`

#### Option C: Quick Test (Bypass Auth Temporarily)
If you want to test the UI without going through full authentication, we can temporarily disable the auth requirement.

### Step 4: Look for the Friends Button
Once on the business dashboard, look for:
- **Top navigation bar** with SynC logo
- **Right side of header** should have 3 buttons:
  1. 👥 **Friends button** (Users icon) ← This is what we're testing!
  2. 🔔 **Notifications button** (Bell icon)
  3. 👤 **Profile button** (User icon)

### Step 5: Test ContactsSidebar
1. **Click the Friends button** (👥 Users icon)
2. **Expected Result**: A sidebar should slide in from the right showing:
   - Title: "Your Friends"
   - Friend list interface
   - Search functionality
   - Add friend options

3. **Test Closing**: Click the X button or click outside to close

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't see the Friends button
**Possible causes:**
- Not authenticated (business dashboard requires login)
- Still in loading state (component loading businesses data)
- Component error

**Solutions:**
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Verify you're logged in
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue: Button exists but sidebar doesn't open
**Possible causes:**
- JavaScript error preventing sidebar from showing
- ContactsSidebar component has rendering issues

**Solutions:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Look for any error messages in the UI

### Issue: Redirected to login page
**Expected behavior** - The business dashboard requires authentication.
**Solution:** Complete the login process first.
