-- Test Bidirectional Unfriend Functionality
-- This script tests that unfriending works both ways

-- First, let's check if the remove_friend function exists

-- Test 2: Create two test users if they don't exist
-- (This assumes you have test users in your system - adjust the user IDs as needed)
-- You can replace these UUIDs with actual user IDs from your system

SELECT '2. Note their user IDs from the query above' as step_2;
SELECT '3. Replace the UUIDs in the queries below with actual user IDs' as step_3;

-- Test 3: Test the remove_friend function
-- IMPORTANT: Replace these UUIDs with actual user IDs from your database
-- Example format (uncomment and modify with real UUIDs):

/*
-- Replace 'user1-uuid-here' and 'user2-uuid-here' with actual UUIDs

-- Set the current auth context to user1 (this would normally be done by authentication)

-- Test removing friend from user1's perspective

-- Test what happens when trying to remove a non-existent friendship
-- This should return false but not throw an error

SELECT '2. It deletes the single row in friend_connections that represents the bidirectional friendship' as logic_2;
SELECT '3. Since there is only one row per friendship pair, removing it affects both users' as logic_3;
SELECT '4. Both users will no longer see each other as friends after the deletion' as logic_4;

SELECT 'To create a test friendship for testing:' as create_test;
SELECT 'Use the send_friend_request function followed by accept_friend_request' as create_step_1;
