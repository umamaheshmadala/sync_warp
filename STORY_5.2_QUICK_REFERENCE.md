## ⚡ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dev Server Won't Start
```bash
# Kill existing processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
# Restart
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Import Error for BusinessReviews
- Check import path: `../reviews/BusinessReviews` (NOT `./BusinessReviews`)
- Verify file exists at: `src/components/reviews/BusinessReviews.tsx`

### Issue: /businesses Returns 404
- Check `src/router/Router.tsx` contains `/businesses` route
- Restart dev server after route changes

### Issue: Reviews Tab Not Showing
- Check tabs array includes `{ id: 'reviews', ... }`
- Verify `renderReviews()` function exists
- Check tab rendering includes `{activeTab === 'reviews' && renderReviews()}`

### Issue: Cannot Write Review
- Verify user is logged in
- Check user has active check-in at business
- Verify user is not the business owner
- Check browser console for errors
