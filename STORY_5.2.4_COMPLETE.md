## Notification Flow

### Review Posted Notification (to Merchant):

```
User writes review
  ‚îî‚îÄ> createReview() called
      ‚îî‚îÄ> Review saved to database ‚úÖ
      ‚îî‚îÄ> Get reviewer's name from profiles
      ‚îî‚îÄ> notifyMerchantNewReview()
          ‚îú‚îÄ> Get business owner user_id
          ‚îú‚îÄ> Create notification
          ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> Type: 'review_posted'
          ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> Title: "New Review Received"
          ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> Message: "{Name} üëç recommends your business"
          ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ> Data: { business_id, review_id, reviewer_name, recommendation }
          ‚îî‚îÄ> Console log success ‚úÖ
```

### Response Notification (to User):

```
Business owner responds
  ‚îî‚îÄ> createResponse() called
      ‚îî‚îÄ> Response saved to database ‚úÖ
      ‚îî‚îÄ> Get review details (user_id, business_name)
      ‚îî‚îÄ> notifyUserReviewResponse()
          ‚îú‚îÄ> Create notification
          ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> Type: 'review_response'
          ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> Title: "Business Responded to Your Review"
          ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> Message: "{Business Name} has responded to your review"
          ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ> Data: { review_id, business_name }
          ‚îî‚îÄ> Console log success ‚úÖ
```

## Notification Data Structure

```typescript
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;                    // Who receives the notification
  type: NotificationType;             // Type of notification
  title: string;                      // Notification title
  message: string;                    // Notification message
  data: Record<string, any>;          // Additional context data
  is_read: boolean;                   // Read status
  created_at: string;                 // When created
  expires_at: string | null;          // Optional expiry
}
```

### Example Notification Data:

**Review Posted (to Merchant):**
```json
{
  "type": "review_posted",
  "title": "New Review Received",
  "message": "John Doe üëç recommends your business",
  "data": {
    "business_id": "uuid-123",
    "business_name": "Coffee Shop",
    "review_id": "uuid-456",
    "reviewer_name": "John Doe",
    "recommendation": true
  }
}
```

**Response Notification (to User):**
```json
{
  "type": "review_response",
  "title": "Business Responded to Your Review",
  "message": "Coffee Shop has responded to your review",
  "data": {
    "review_id": "uuid-456",
    "business_name": "Coffee Shop"
  }
}
```

## Code Changes

### New Files:
1. **src/services/notificationService.ts** - Complete notification service
2. **supabase/migrations/20250101000000_add_review_notification_types.sql** - DB migration

### Modified Files:
1. **src/services/reviewService.ts**
   - Added notification imports
   - Added notification call after review creation
   - Added notification call after response creation
   - Fetch user profile for reviewer name
   - Fetch review details for response notification

---

## Error Handling

### Non-Blocking Notifications:
```typescript
notifyMerchantNewReview(...)
  .catch(err => console.error('Failed to send review notification:', err));
```

**Rationale:**
- Review/response operations should never fail due to notification errors
- Notifications are sent asynchronously
- Errors are logged but don't throw
- User experience remains smooth even if notifications fail

### Graceful Degradation:
- If business owner not found ‚Üí Notification not sent (logged)
- If profile not found ‚Üí Uses fallback name "A customer"
- If review details not found ‚Üí Notification not sent (logged)
- Database errors ‚Üí Logged, no user impact

---

## Database Schema

### favorite_notifications Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE favorite_notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN (..., 'review_posted', 'review_response', ...)),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### Indexes:
- `idx_favorite_notifications_user_id` - Fast user lookups
- `idx_favorite_notifications_is_read` - Filter unread
- `idx_favorite_notifications_created_at` - Sort by time
- `idx_favorite_notifications_type` - Filter by type (NEW)

### RLS Policies:
- Users can view their own notifications
- Users can update their own notifications (mark as read)
- No direct insert (handled by service)

---

## Usage Examples

### Get User Notifications:
```typescript
import { getUserNotifications } from '../services/notificationService';

const notifications = await getUserNotifications(userId, 50, false);
```

### Mark as Read:
```typescript
import { markNotificationAsRead } from '../services/notificationService';

await markNotificationAsRead(notificationId);
```

### Get Unread Count:
```typescript
import { getUnreadNotificationCount } from '../services/notificationService';

const count = await getUnreadNotificationCount(userId);
```

---

## Console Logging

Notifications include helpful console logs for debugging:

```
‚úÖ Review created successfully: { id: 'uuid-123', ... }
‚úÖ Notified merchant (uuid-456) about new review
```

```
‚úÖ Response created successfully: { id: 'uuid-789', ... }
‚úÖ Notified user (uuid-012) about business response
```

```
‚ùå Error fetching business: { code: 'PGRST116', ... }
Failed to send review notification: Error: ...
```

---

## Testing Checklist

- ‚úÖ Review posted ‚Üí Merchant receives notification
- ‚úÖ Response posted ‚Üí User receives notification
- ‚úÖ Notification includes correct data
- ‚úÖ Notification title and message are clear
- ‚úÖ Review creation succeeds even if notification fails
- ‚úÖ Response creation succeeds even if notification fails
- ‚úÖ Notifications marked as read correctly
- ‚úÖ Unread count updates correctly
- ‚úÖ Error handling works (no crashes)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Already Prepared For:
- ‚úÖ Check-in notifications (Story 5.2.5)
- ‚úÖ Coupon collected notifications
- ‚úÖ Review edited notifications

### Could Add:
- Email notifications (integrate with email service)
- Push notifications (integrate with FCM/APNS)
- Notification preferences (user settings)
- Notification batching (daily digest)
- Real-time notifications (Supabase realtime)
- Deep linking in notifications
- Rich notification UI with actions

---

## Performance Considerations

### Async Operations:
- Notifications don't block main operations
- Failed notifications don't cause errors
- Database writes happen in parallel

### Indexing:
- Notifications queryable by user_id
- Filterable by is_read status
- Sortable by created_at
- Filterable by type

### Cleanup:
- Consider adding expiry to old notifications
- Could add auto-delete policy (e.g., 30 days)
- Unread notifications prioritized in queries

---

## Integration Points

### Current:
- ‚úÖ Review creation flow
- ‚úÖ Response creation flow

### Planned (Story 5.2.5):
- ‚è≥ Check-in flow
- ‚è≥ Coupon collection flow

### Potential:
- User mentions in reviews

## Success Metrics

This feature enables:
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Engagement:** Merchants know immediately when reviewed
- ‚úÖ **Customer Retention:** Users notified when business engages
- ‚úÖ **Trust Building:** Transparent two-way communication
- ‚úÖ **Business Intelligence:** Merchants stay informed

## Next Steps (Story 5.2.5)

The final story is to implement check-in notifications for merchants:
- Notify merchant when user checks in at their business
- Include user name and check-in time
- Provide analytics context
- Link to customer list or analytics dashboard

Story 5.2.4 successfully implements a complete notification system for reviews! üîî
