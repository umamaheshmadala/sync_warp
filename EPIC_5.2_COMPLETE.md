2. **`review_response`** - User: Business responded to their review
3. **`checkin`** - Merchant: User checked in at their business
4. **`review_edited`** - Merchant: User edited their review (prepared)
5. **`coupon_collected`** - Merchant: User collected a coupon (prepared)

### Notification Flow Diagram:
```
USER ACTIONS                 NOTIFICATIONS SENT
═══════════════              ═══════════════════

Check In                →    Merchant: "John Doe checked in"
Write Review            →    Merchant: "John Doe 👍 recommends"
Edit Review             →    Merchant: "John Doe updated review"
Collect Coupon          →    Merchant: "John Doe collected coupon"

Business Responds       →    User: "Coffee Shop responded to review"
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Check-in Validation for Reviews
**Decision:** Require check-in before allowing review submission  
**Rationale:**
- Ensures authentic reviews from actual customers
- Prevents spam and fake reviews
- Ties reviews to real visits
- Provides business intelligence

### 2. Non-blocking Notifications
**Decision:** All notifications are async and non-blocking  
**Rationale:**
- Core operations (check-in, reviews) must always succeed
- Notification failures shouldn't impact user experience
- Performance: parallel database writes
- Graceful degradation

### 3. Response System Architecture
**Decision:** Store responses in reviews table (not separate table)  
**Rationale:**
- Simpler data model (one-to-one relationship)
- Easier queries (no joins needed)
- Better performance
- Clear ownership (responses belong to reviews)

### 4. Notification Service Layer
**Decision:** Centralized notification service  
**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth
- Consistent notification format
- Easy to extend with new types
- Reusable across features

### 5. UI/UX Patterns
**Decision:** Modal forms for review and response submission  
**Rationale:**
- Focus user attention
- Maintain context (stay on page)
- Better mobile experience
- Clear cancel/submit actions

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Database:
- ✅ Indexed `favorite_notifications` by user_id, is_read, created_at, type
- ✅ Efficient query patterns (single table lookups)
- ✅ Async notification inserts (non-blocking)
- ✅ RLS policies for security

### Frontend:
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates (immediate feedback)
- ✅ Toast notifications for quick feedback
- ✅ Modal forms (no page reloads)
- ✅ Conditional rendering (only show relevant actions)

### API Calls:
- ✅ Single insert operations
- ✅ Batch updates where possible
- ✅ Error handling with retries
- ✅ Profile data fetching for personalization

---
