## Database Integration

### Tables Used:
- ✅ `business_reviews` - Source review data
- ✅ `business_review_responses` - Owner responses

### Operations:
- ✅ `createResponse(data)` - Insert new response
- ✅ `updateResponse(id, data)` - Update existing response
- ✅ RLS policies enforce business ownership

### Response Fields:
```typescript
interface CreateResponseInput {
  review_id: string;
  business_id: string;
  response_text: string; // Max 50 words
}

interface UpdateResponseInput {
  response_text: string; // Max 50 words
}
```

---

## Validation & Constraints

### 50-Word Limit:
- ✅ Enforced in form with real-time counter
- ✅ Submit button disabled if over limit
- ✅ Error message displayed
- ✅ Word count utility function (countWords)

### Business Owner Verification:
- ✅ Only business owners see "Respond" button
- ✅ Only owners can edit their responses
- ✅ Verified via `isBusinessOwner` prop chain
- ✅ RLS policies enforce at database level

### Response Uniqueness:
- ✅ One response per review
- ✅ Existing response shown instead of "Respond" button
- ✅ Edit functionality replaces create when response exists

---

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Business owner sees "Respond" button on own business reviews
- ✅ Non-owners don't see "Respond" button
- ✅ Modal opens with correct review/business context
- ✅ 50-word limit enforced
- ✅ Word counter displays correctly
- ✅ Submit disabled when invalid
- ✅ Success toast appears after submission
- ✅ Response appears in review list after submit
- ✅ OWNER badge displays on responses
- ✅ Edit button visible only to business owner
- ✅ Edit modal pre-fills with existing response
- ✅ Update response works correctly
- ✅ Error handling works for failed submissions

---

## Known Behaviors

1. **Page Reload After Response:**
   - Currently uses `window.location.reload()` after successful response
   - Simple approach that ensures fresh data
   - Can be improved with optimistic updates or refetch hooks

2. **Single Response Per Review:**
   - Business can only respond once per review
   - Can edit/update their response anytime
   - Follows standard review platform patterns

3. **No Delete Response:**
   - Currently no option to delete response
   - Edit to blank text would be workaround
   - Can be added in future if needed

---

## Best Practices Implemented

### For Business Owners:
- 50-word limit keeps responses concise
- Best practices guide shown in modal
- Professional "OWNER" badge for credibility
- Edit capability for corrections
- Timestamp shows engagement recency

### For Customers:
- Clear visual distinction (blue background)
- Owner badge builds trust
- Timestamp provides context
- Clean, readable design
- Responses don't clutter review

---

## Next Steps (Story 5.2.4)

Now that business owners can respond to reviews, the next step is to implement notifications:
- Notify merchant when review is posted
- Notify user when business responds to their review
- Deep-link notifications to relevant review
- Notification preferences in settings

---

## Performance Notes

- Responses load with reviews (single query via view)
- Modal opens instantly (component already loaded)
- Form validation is client-side (fast)
- Submission is optimistic-feeling with loading states
- Page reload ensures consistency (trade-off)

---

## Success Metrics

This feature enables:
- ✅ **Customer Engagement:** Business owners can engage with feedback
- ✅ **Trust Building:** Responses show business cares about customers
- ✅ **Issue Resolution:** Owners can address concerns publicly
- ✅ **Professional Image:** OWNER badge enhances credibility
- ✅ **Community Building:** Two-way communication between businesses and customers
