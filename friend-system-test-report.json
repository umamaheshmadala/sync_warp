  "manualTestInstructions": "\nMANUAL TESTING GUIDE:\n\n1. DATABASE SETUP:\n   - Run fix-friend-system-comprehensive.sql in Supabase SQL Editor\n   - Verify all tables exist and have proper policies\n   - Check that test users have correct profiles\n\n2. FRIEND REQUEST FLOW:\n   a) Sign in as testuser1@gmail.com\n   b) Click floating friend button\n   c) Click \"Find Friends\" \n   d) Search for \"Test User 2\"\n   e) Click \"Add\" button\n   f) Verify button changes to \"Sent âœ“\"\n   g) Sign out\n\n   h) Sign in as testuser2@gmail.com  \n   i) Click floating friend button\n   j) Click \"Requests\" (should have red badge)\n   k) Verify pending request from Test User 1\n   l) Click \"Accept\"\n   m) Verify request disappears and friendship created\n\n3. VERIFICATION:\n   - Check friends appear in friends list\n   - Verify online status indicators work\n   - Test that data persists after page refresh\n   - Check database tables for correct data\n\n4. ERROR TESTING:\n   - Try sending duplicate requests (should fail gracefully)\n   - Try accepting already accepted requests\n   - Check console for any remaining errors\n\n5. PERFORMANCE:\n   - Monitor console for excessive re-renders\n   - Check network tab for unnecessary API calls\n   - Verify smooth UI interactions\n",
