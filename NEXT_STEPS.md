5. Copy ALL contents and paste into SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" or `Ctrl+Enter`
7. Verify success: Check Tables ‚Üí See `favorite_products`

#### Method B: Using MCP Supabase Tool
If you have Supabase MCP configured:

- name: create_favorite_products
- query: [contents of migration file]
```

**üìñ Full guide:** See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM favorite_products WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```
