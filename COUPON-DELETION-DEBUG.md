# 🔍 Coupon Deletion Debug Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified:
**Deleted coupons reappearing after page refresh**

## 🔧 Changes Applied:

### 1. **Fixed Double Toast Messages**
- **Problem**: Two "Coupon removed from wallet" toasts appearing
- **Cause**: Both the component AND the hook were showing success toasts
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate toast from `CouponWallet.tsx` (line 178)

### 2. **Added Comprehensive Debug Logging**

#### In `useCoupons.ts`:
- `🔍 [fetchUserCoupons]` - When fetching coupons
- `✅ [fetchUserCoupons] Fetched X active coupons` - Shows count
- `🗑️ [removeCouponCollection] Starting removal` - Deletion started
- `✅ [removeCouponCollection] Database updated successfully` - Shows updated data
- `🛠️ [removeCouponCollection] Cache invalidated` - Cache cleared
- `🔄 [removeCouponCollection] Refreshing coupon list` - Refetch started
- `✅ [removeCouponCollection] Coupon list refreshed` - Refetch complete

#### In `CouponWallet.tsx`:
- `🗑️ [CouponWallet] Removing coupon collection` - Component initiates deletion
- `✅ [CouponWallet] Coupon removed successfully` - Component confirms

### 3. **Improved Database Update Confirmation**
- Added `.select()` to the update query to return the updated row
- This confirms the database actually updated the status to 'removed'

## 🧪 Testing Instructions:

### Test the Complete Flow:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Navigate to `/wallet`**
3. **Delete a coupon** - Watch for these logs in order:
   ```
   🗑️ [CouponWallet] Removing coupon collection: [id]
   🗑️ [removeCouponCollection] Starting removal - Collection ID: [id]
   ✅ [removeCouponCollection] Database updated successfully: [{...}]
   🛠️ [removeCouponCollection] Cache invalidated for user: [user-id]
   🔄 [removeCouponCollection] Refreshing coupon list...
   🔍 [fetchUserCoupons] Fetching coupons for user: [user-id]
   ✅ [fetchUserCoupons] Fetched X active coupons
   ✅ [removeCouponCollection] Coupon list refreshed
   ✅ [CouponWallet] Coupon removed successfully
   ```

4. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Only ONE toast: "Coupon removed from wallet"
   - ✅ Coupon disappears immediately
   - ✅ Console shows all steps complete successfully

5. **Refresh the Page** (F5):
   ```
   🔍 [fetchUserCoupons] Fetching coupons for user: [user-id]
   ✅ [fetchUserCoupons] Fetched X active coupons
   ```
   - ✅ Deleted coupon should NOT reappear
   - ✅ Count should be one less than before

## 🎯 What to Look For:

### ✅ **Success Indicators**:
1. Database update returns the modified row with `status: 'removed'`
2. Fetch after deletion returns FEWER coupons than before
3. Coupon count decreases correctly
4. Page refresh doesn't bring back deleted coupons

### ❌ **Failure Indicators**:
1. Database update returns empty array or error
2. Fetch still returns the same number of coupons
3. Console shows errors at any step
4. Coupon reappears after refresh

## 🔬 Debugging Steps:

If coupons still reappear:

1. **Check the database update log**:
   - Does `✅ [removeCouponCollection] Database updated successfully` show a row with `status: "removed"`?
   - If empty array: RLS policy might be blocking the update

2. **Check the fetch log**:
   - Does the coupon count decrease after deletion?
   - If not: Database filter isn't working or update didn't persist

3. **Check for errors**:
   - Any `❌` error logs?
   - Any database constraint violations?

4. **Verify in database** (if needed):
   ```sql
   SELECT id, coupon_id, user_id, status, deleted_at 
   FROM user_coupon_collections 
   WHERE user_id = '[your-user-id]'
   ORDER BY collected_at DESC;
   ```

## 🚀 Ready to Test:

Your dev server is running at `http://localhost:5173/`

**Quick Test**: Delete coupon → Check console logs → Refresh page → Verify it's gone ✅

The extensive logging will show exactly where the process might be failing if issues persist.
