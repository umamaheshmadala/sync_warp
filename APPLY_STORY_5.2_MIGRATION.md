## üß™ Verify Migration Applied

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('business_reviews', 'business_review_responses');

-- Check if view exists
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.views 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 'business_reviews_with_details';

-- Check if function exists
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name = 'get_business_review_stats';
```

**Expected Results:**
- 2 tables found
- 1 view found
- 1 function found

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation already exists"
**Solution:** Migration already applied! Your issue might be different. Check if view exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM business_reviews_with_details LIMIT 1;
```

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project

### Error: "syntax error"
**Solution:** Make sure you copied the ENTIRE migration file (all 376 lines)
