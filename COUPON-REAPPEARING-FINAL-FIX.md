# 🎯 FINAL FIX: Coupons Reappearing After Deletion

## 🐛 **Root Cause Identified:**

The deletion was working correctly in the database! The problem was that **two different data fetching paths** were being used:

1. **`useUserCoupons` hook** → `fetchUserCoupons()` → ✅ Filters by `.eq('status', 'active')`
2. **`couponService`** → `getUserCollectedCoupons()` → ❌ **NO status filter!**

The `CouponWallet` component was using `couponService.getUserCollectedCoupons()` which returned **ALL** coupons including removed ones!

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### **File: `src/services/couponService.ts` (Line 927)**

**Before:**
```typescript
.eq('user_id', userId)
.order('collected_at', { ascending: false });
// ❌ Returns ALL coupons (active, removed, expired, etc.)
```

**After:**
```typescript
.eq('user_id', userId)
.eq('status', 'active') // ✅ Only fetch active coupons
.order('collected_at', { ascending: false });
```

### **Added Debug Logging:**
```typescript
console.log('🔍 [couponService] Getting collected coupons for user:', userId);
console.log('✅ [couponService] Fetched', data?.length || 0, 'active coupons');
```

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions:**

1. **Delete all coupons from wallet**
2. **Watch console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   🗑️ [CouponWallet] Removing coupon collection: [id]
   🗑️ [removeCouponCollection] Starting removal...
   ✅ [removeCouponCollection] Database updated successfully
   🔄 [removeCouponCollection] Refreshing coupon list...
   🔍 [fetchUserCoupons] Fetching coupons for user: [id]
   ✅ [fetchUserCoupons] Fetched 0 active coupons  ← Should be 0
   ```

3. **Refresh the page (F5)**
4. **Check console logs again**:
   ```
   🔍 [fetchUserCoupons] Fetching coupons for user: [id]
   ✅ [fetchUserCoupons] Fetched 0 active coupons  ← Still 0!
   🔍 [couponService] Getting collected coupons for user: [id]
   ✅ [couponService] Fetched 0 active coupons  ← NOW filtered correctly!
   ```

5. **Wallet should be empty** ✅

## 📊 **What Was Happening:**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Delete Coupon → Updates DB: status = 'removed' ✅
↓
Immediate UI Update → Filters correctly: 0 coupons ✅
↓
Page Refresh → loadWalletData() is called
↓
getUserCollectedCoupons() → Returns ALL coupons ❌
↓
Removed coupons reappear! 😱
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Delete Coupon → Updates DB: status = 'removed' ✅
↓
Immediate UI Update → Filters correctly: 0 coupons ✅
↓
Page Refresh → loadWalletData() is called
↓
getUserCollectedCoupons() → NOW filters by status='active' ✅
↓
Wallet stays empty! 🎉
```

## 🎉 **Expected Behavior Now:**

1. ✅ Delete coupons → They disappear immediately
2. ✅ Only ONE toast appears: "Coupon removed from wallet"
3. ✅ Refresh page → Coupons stay deleted
4. ✅ Both data paths (hook & service) now filter consistently

## 🚀 **Ready to Test:**

Your dev server should already be running. Just:
1. Refresh the wallet page
2. Confirm deleted coupons don't reappear
3. Check console to see the new `[couponService]` logs

This fix ensures **both** data fetching methods respect the 'removed' status, so coupons stay deleted across page refreshes!
