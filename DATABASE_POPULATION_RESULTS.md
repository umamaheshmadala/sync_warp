### 3️⃣ **businesses** (4 rows updated) ✅
**Script:** `03_update_businesses_with_cities.sql`

Updated 4 existing businesses with city assignments for location-based targeting:
- **Cities Assigned**: Random distribution across 10 major US cities
  - New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix
  - Philadelphia, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, Austin

**Key Columns Updated:**
- `city` - Added city name
- `updated_at` - Timestamp of update

---

### 4️⃣ **profiles** (3 rows - unchanged) ⚠️
**Script:** `01_populate_profiles.sql`

**Status**: Script failed to insert new rows due to foreign key constraint.

**Issue**: The `profiles` table has `CONSTRAINT profiles_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES auth.users.id`, which means you cannot insert profiles without corresponding authenticated users in the `auth.users` table.

**What was attempted**: Insert 100 new test profiles with:
- Email: `user1@synctest.com` through `user100@synctest.com`
- Full names, avatars, phone numbers, cities
- Random city assignments

**Result**: Only the 3 existing profiles remain. New auth users must be created first.

## 📌 Next Steps

To get even more realistic data (100+ profiles):

1. **Create auth users** via Supabase Admin SDK or Dashboard
2. **Re-run script 01** to populate profiles
3. **Re-run scripts 02-04** to create more drivers/customers

See `EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed instructions on how to create auth users.
