# 🎯 Targeting Filters - Complete Fix

## Issues Identified & Solutions

### Issue #1: Location Filter - Single City Problem ❌
**Problem:** All 10,000 users were in Vijayawada only. Bengaluru campaigns showed 0 users.

**Solution:** ✅
- Generated users across **5 major cities:**
  - Bengaluru (2,000 users)
  - Vijayawada (2,000 users)
  - Hyderabad (2,000 users)
  - Chennai (2,000 users)
  - Mumbai (2,000 users)
- Each city has users distributed within 20km radius
- Campaigns can now target users based on business location

---

### Issue #2: Behavior Filters - Missing Data ❌
**Problem:** No columns to identify users by behavior (new customer, existing, power user, checked-in, nearby).

**Solution:** ✅ Added behavior tracking columns:

| Column | Purpose | Data Distribution |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `last_active_at` | Track engagement | 80% active in last 90 days |
| `signup_date` | New vs existing | Spread over last 2 years |
| `last_purchase_at` | Customer type | 60% have purchased |
| `checkin_count` | Location engagement | 30% have checked in |
| `favorite_businesses` | Power users | 10% power users (3+ favorites) |

**Behavior Segments Now Work:**
- **New Customers**: Signed up recently, no purchases (~10%)
- **Existing Customers**: Have made purchases (~60%)
- **Power Users**: 3+ favorite businesses OR 20+ purchases (~10%)
- **Checked-In Users**: checkin_count > 0 (~30%)
- **Nearby Users**: Within radius (calculated via PostGIS)

---

### Issue #3: Interest Categories - Not Stored ❌
**Problem:** No column for user interests.

**Solution:** ✅
- The `interests` column already exists (TEXT[] type)
- Populated with 12 realistic categories:
  - food, shopping, entertainment, health
  - travel, education, services, sports
  - technology, fashion, home, automotive
- Each user has 2-4 random interests
- Businesses can target users by interest categories

---

### Issue #4: Demographics - Age Range vs Fixed Age ❌
**Problem:** Users had age_range like '35-44' but no fixed age. Filters couldn't work accurately.

**Solution:** ✅ Added proper age handling:

1. **Added `date_of_birth` column** (DATE)
   - For accurate age calculation
   - Enables birthday campaigns
   - Ages 18-70 distributed randomly

2. **Fixed `age` column** (INTEGER)
   - Stored as fixed number (e.g., 35)
   - Calculated from date_of_birth

3. **Kept `age_range` column** (TEXT)
   - Derived from age
   - For quick range filtering
   - Values: '18-24', '25-34', '35-44', '45-54', '55-64', '65+'

**Now works correctly:**
```sql
-- Filter users aged 25-34
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 34;

-- Or use age_range
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE age_range = '25-34';
```

---

### Issue #5: User Onboarding - DOB Collection ❌
**Problem:** Not collecting date of birth during onboarding.

**Solution:** ✅ (Requires frontend update)
- Added `date_of_birth` column to database ✅
- **TODO**: Add DOB field to user onboarding form

**Benefits:**
1. Accurate age-based targeting
2. Birthday month campaigns
3. Age-restricted offers
4. Better personalization

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Run Schema Migration
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250114_add_behavior_columns.sql
-- This adds all new columns to user_profiles table
```

Run in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ysxmgbblljoyebvugrfo/sql/new

### Step 2: Run Data Migration
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250114_seed_users_COMPLETE.sql
-- This generates 10,000 users across 5 cities with full behavior data
```

Run in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor.

**Expected Output:**
```

## Database Schema Changes

### New Columns Added

```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN date_of_birth DATE;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN last_active_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN signup_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN last_purchase_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN checkin_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN favorite_businesses UUID[];
```

### New Indexes Created

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_city ON user_profiles(city);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_age ON user_profiles(age);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_dob ON user_profiles(date_of_birth);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_last_active ON user_profiles(last_active_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_signup ON user_profiles(signup_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_last_purchase ON user_profiles(last_purchase_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_checkin ON user_profiles(checkin_count);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_interests ON user_profiles USING GIN(interests);
```

## Helper Functions

### get_customer_segment()
Returns customer segment for targeting:

```sql
SELECT get_customer_segment(
  signup_date,
  last_purchase_at,
  total_purchases,
  checkin_count,
  favorite_businesses
) as segment
FROM user_profiles;
```

Returns: `'power_users'`, `'new_customers'`, `'existing_customers'`, `'checked_in'`, or `'regular'`

## Frontend Updates Required

### 1. User Onboarding Form
Add date of birth field:

```typescript
<FormField
  label="Date of Birth"
  type="date"
  name="date_of_birth"
  required
  max={new Date(Date.now() - 18*365*24*60*60*1000).toISOString().split('T')[0]}
  help="Must be 18 years or older"
/>
```

### 2. Birthday Campaigns (Future Feature)
With DOB data, you can create birthday campaigns:
- Send offers during user's birthday month
- Age-milestone campaigns (e.g., turning 30)
- Seasonal campaigns by age group
