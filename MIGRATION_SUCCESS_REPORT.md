## 🧪 Test the Paid Ads System

### Option 1: Automatic Test (Refresh Browser)
1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or F5) on http://localhost:5174/
2. **Navigate to Dashboard** (if not already there)
3. **Observe the carousel:**
   - Should now show **2 PAID ADS** first
   - Labeled "✨ Sponsored" (yellow badge)
   - Followed by **4 organic cards**
   - Labeled "Recommended" (green badge)

### Option 2: Manual Test in Chrome DevTools

**Console Tab - Check for changes:**
```javascript
// Before: 404 error on /ads endpoint
// After: Success! Ads loaded

// You should see the network request succeed:
// GET /rest/v1/ads?...
// Status: 200 OK
```

**Network Tab - Verify API call:**
1. Filter by "ads"
2. Should see successful GET request
3. Response should contain 2 ads with status "active"

**Elements Tab - Inspect badges:**
- First 2 cards: "✨ Sponsored" badge
- Remaining cards: "Recommended" badge

## 📊 Verify Tracking Works

### Test Impression Tracking

**Method 1: Automatic (Just View)**
Impressions are tracked automatically when ads are viewed. Just let the carousel run!

**Method 2: Check Database**
```sql
SELECT id, title, impressions, clicks FROM ads;
```
You should see `impressions` incrementing each time the carousel displays the ad.

### Test Click Tracking

**Method 1: Click the Ad Card**
1. Click on one of the paid ad cards
2. Check the console (should see tracking call)
3. Verify `clicks` counter increments

**Method 2: Check Database**
```sql
SELECT id, title, impressions, clicks FROM ads;
```
After clicking, `clicks` should be > 0.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing mock data
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear cache

### Issue: Ads not showing
**Solution:** 
```sql
-- Check if ads exist and are active
SELECT * FROM ads WHERE status = 'active' AND type = 'carousel';
```

### Issue: Tracking not working
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname IN ('track_ad_impression', 'track_ad_click');
```

### Issue: Console errors
**Solution:** Check that user is authenticated (ads require auth)
