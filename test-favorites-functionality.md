# CRITICAL ISSUE: Favorites Functionality Completely Broken

## Status: UNRESOLVED - REQUIRES DEEPER INVESTIGATION

Multiple attempts to fix have failed. The issue is deeper than initially diagnosed.

## Root Cause Analysis Needed:

1. **Database Level Issues**:
   - RPC functions may not exist or be incorrectly implemented
   - Supabase connection/authentication issues
   - Missing tables or incorrect table structure
   - RLS policies blocking operations

2. **Frontend State Management Issues**:
   - React state not updating correctly
   - Cache synchronization problems between components
   - useEffect dependencies causing infinite loops or stale closures
   - Context/hook sharing issues

3. **Authentication Issues**:
   - User authentication state not properly passed to favorites functions
   - Session token issues with Supabase
   - RLS policies requiring proper user context

## Systematic Debugging Required:

1. **Step 1: Database Verification**
   ```sql
   -- Check if tables exist
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name LIKE '%favorite%';
   
   -- Check if functions exist
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_schema = 'public' AND routine_name LIKE '%favorite%';
   
   -- Test functions manually with real user ID
   SELECT toggle_business_favorite('real-business-id');
   ```

2. **Step 2: Frontend Network Analysis**
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Monitor Network tab when clicking hearts
   - Check for failed requests, authentication errors
   - Verify request payload and response structure

3. **Step 3: Component State Debugging**
   - Add extensive console logging to useFavorites hook
   - Add state debugging component to show real-time cache state
   - Track state changes through entire component lifecycle

## ACCEPTANCE:
I was not capable of fixing this issue with multiple attempts. 
Requires hands-on debugging with browser dev tools and direct database testing.

# Testing Favorites Functionality

## Prerequisites
1. Development server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. User is logged in
3. Test data exists in the database (run `create-basic-test-data.sql` if needed)

## Test Steps

### 1. Test Heart Icon Color Change
1. Navigate to any page with business cards (e.g., search results)
2. Find a business card with a heart icon (SaveButton)
3. Click the heart icon
4. **Expected**: Heart icon should immediately change from gray to red (filled)
5. Click the heart icon again
6. **Expected**: Heart icon should change from red back to gray (outline only)

### 2. Test Favorites Page Display  
1. Add a few businesses and coupons to favorites using the heart icons
2. Navigate to `/favorites` page
3. **Expected**: Should see:
   - Correct counts in the tabs (Businesses, Coupons, Wishlist)
   - Business cards displayed under "Businesses" tab
   - Coupon cards displayed under "Coupons" tab
   - Each item should have a red/filled heart icon indicating it's favorited

### 3. Test State Persistence
1. Add items to favorites
2. Refresh the page
3. **Expected**: Favorites should still be there and heart icons should remain red

### 4. Test Remove from Favorites Page
1. Go to Favorites page
2. Click the heart icon on any favorited item
3. **Expected**: 
   - Item should be removed from the favorites list
   - Count should decrease
   - Toast message should show "Removed from favorites"

## Debugging Tips
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Look for network requests to Supabase in Network tab
- Verify authentication state in AuthDebug panel if enabled

## Common Issues and Fixes
1. **Heart icon not changing color**: Cache update issue - check console logs
2. **Items not showing on Favorites page**: Database query issue - check if RPC functions exist
3. **Authentication errors**: User not logged in or session expired
4. **Database errors**: Tables or functions not created - run migration script

## Database Verification
Run these queries in Supabase SQL editor to verify data:

```sql
-- Check if user has any favorites
SELECT COUNT(*) as business_favorites FROM user_favorites_businesses 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

SELECT COUNT(*) as coupon_favorites FROM user_favorites_coupons 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- Check if test data exists
SELECT business_name FROM businesses LIMIT 5;
SELECT title FROM business_coupons LIMIT 5;
```
