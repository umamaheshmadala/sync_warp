## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**Issue 1: Dev Server Timeout**
```bash
Error: Timed out waiting 120000ms from config.webServer

Solution:
# Start dev server manually
npm run dev

# Then run tests with CI flag
$env:CI = "true"
npm run test:e2e:headless
```

**Issue 2: Port Already in Use**
```powershell
# Find and kill process on port 5173
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5173 | 
  ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -Force }

# Then start dev server
npm run dev
```

**Issue 3: Supabase Connection**
```bash
# Verify .env file
cat .env | Select-String "VITE_SUPABASE"

# Check Supabase project status
# Ensure URL and keys are correct
```

**Issue 4: Test Timeouts**
```typescript
// Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts
use: {
  actionTimeout: 30000,  // Increase from 15000
  navigationTimeout: 60000,
}
```

**Issue 5: Element Not Found**
```bash
# Run in debug mode to inspect elements
npm run test:e2e:debug

# This opens browser and pauses at each step
# Allows you to inspect selectors
```
