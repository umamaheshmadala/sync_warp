## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Button not shown to business owners
- ✅ Button not shown to non-logged-in users
- ✅ Button disabled when no check-in exists
- ✅ Button enabled when check-in exists

- ✅ Form submission works

---

## Next Steps (Story 5.2.2)

Now that users can write reviews, the next step is to implement the "My Reviews" page where users can:
- View all their reviews across all businesses
- Filter by recommendation type
- Edit reviews (within 24 hours)
- Delete reviews
- Navigate to businesses from reviews

---

## Database Dependencies

- ✅ `business_checkins` table exists
- ✅ `business_reviews` table exists
- ✅ RLS policies allow user check-in queries
- ✅ Check-in requirement enforced via foreign key

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Check-in expiration:** Currently any check-in works, no time limit enforcement in UI
2. **Multiple check-ins:** Only uses most recent check-in
3. **Review cooldown:** No UI enforcement of review frequency limits

These can be addressed in future iterations if needed.
