## 🚀 Execution Strategy

### Development Approach:
1. **Sequential for Epic 5** - Story 5.2 → Story 5.5
2. **Phased for Epic 6** - Foundation → Monetization → Compliance
3. **Test after each story**
4. **Document as we build**

### Team Organization:
- **Epic 5**: Focus entire team (2 weeks)
- **Epic 6 Phase 1**: Basic admin (3 weeks)
- **Epic 6 Phase 2**: Monetization critical (4 weeks)
- **Epic 6 Phase 3**: Compliance & polish (3 weeks)

### Risk Mitigation:
- ✅ Epic 5 dependencies all met
- ✅ Database schemas pre-designed
- ✅ Service layer patterns established
- ⚠️ Admin subdomain setup needs DevOps
- ⚠️ Driver algorithm needs testing with real data
- ⚠️ Billing integration needs payment gateway
