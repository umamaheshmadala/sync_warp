## Key Integration Testing Patterns

### 1. Multi-Step Form Testing

```typescript
// Pattern: Navigate through steps and validate data persistence
const titleInput = screen.getByPlaceholderText(/title/i);
await user.type(titleInput, 'Test Data');

const nextButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /next/i });
await user.click(nextButton);

await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByText('Step 2')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// Go back and verify data persisted
const backButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /back/i });
await user.click(backButton);

expect(titleInput).toHaveValue('Test Data');
```

### 2. Error Boundary Testing

```typescript
// Pattern: Test error catching and recovery
const ThrowError = ({ shouldThrow }) => {
  if (shouldThrow) throw new Error('Test error');
  return <div>No error</div>;
};

render(
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <ThrowError shouldThrow={true} />
  </ErrorBoundary>
);

expect(screen.getByText(/something went wrong/i)).toBeInTheDocument();

// Test recovery
const tryAgainButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /try again/i });
await user.click(tryAgainButton);

expect(screen.getByText('No error')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

### 3. Authentication Flow Testing

```typescript
// Pattern: Test complete auth flow with state changes
const mockSignIn = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined);
vi.mocked(useAuthStore).mockReturnValue({
  signIn: mockSignIn,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
});

await user.type(screen.getByPlaceholderText('Email'), 'test@example.com');
await user.type(screen.getByPlaceholderText('Password'), 'password123');
await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /sign in/i }));

await waitFor(() => {
  expect(mockSignIn).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test@example.com', 'password123');
});
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Component Mocking
**Solution**: Created comprehensive mock implementations for Supabase, React Router, and custom hooks that accurately simulate real behavior while remaining testable.

### Challenge 2: Multi-Step Form State Management
**Solution**: Implemented tests that verify form state persistence across steps using both component state and sessionStorage.

### Challenge 3: Realistic User Interactions
**Solution**: Leveraged @testing-library/user-event for realistic user interactions including typing, clicking, and form submissions with proper async handling.

### Challenge 4: Error Boundary Testing
**Solution**: Created test components that deliberately throw errors at specific times, allowing verification of error catching, recovery, and isolation behavior.

---

## Testing Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**: All tests follow clear AAA structure
2. **Descriptive Test Names**: Tests clearly describe what they're testing
3. **Proper Async Handling**: All async operations use waitFor and proper error handling
4. **Mock Isolation**: Each test has properly isolated mocks
5. **User-Centric Testing**: Tests simulate real user behavior
6. **Error Scenario Coverage**: Both happy paths and error cases tested
7. **Accessibility**: Tests use accessible queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)

---

## Recommendations for Future Testing

### Short Term
1. **Fix Mock Configuration**: Address the React Router mock issues in BusinessRegistration tests
2. **Add React Import**: Update auth flow tests to properly import React
3. **Run Integration Suite**: Execute all integration tests after mock fixes

### Medium Term
1. **E2E Testing**: Consider adding Playwright/Cypress for true end-to-end testing
2. **Visual Regression**: Add visual regression testing for UI components
3. **Performance Testing**: Add performance benchmarks for critical user flows

### Long Term
1. **Test Automation**: Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
2. **Coverage Goals**: Aim for 95%+ coverage on critical paths
3. **Load Testing**: Add load/stress testing for API endpoints
