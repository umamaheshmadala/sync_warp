  recommendation BOOLEAN NOT NULL, -- true = 👍 recommend, false = 👎 don't recommend
  review_text TEXT CHECK (
    review_text IS NULL OR 
    array_length(string_to_array(review_text, ' '), 1) <= 30
  ), -- Max 30 words
  checkin_id UUID REFERENCES business_checkins(id), -- GPS verification requirement
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_edited BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  
  -- Constraints
  CONSTRAINT unique_user_business_review UNIQUE(user_id, business_id),

  response_text TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (
    array_length(string_to_array(response_text, ' '), 1) <= 50
  ), -- Max 50 words for responses
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  CONSTRAINT unique_review_response UNIQUE(review_id)
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_business ON business_reviews(business_id);

  ON business_reviews FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = user_id AND
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM business_checkins 
      WHERE id = checkin_id AND user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

  IF total_reviews > 0 THEN
    recommendation_percentage := ROUND((recommend_count::NUMERIC / total_reviews::NUMERIC) * 100, 1);
  ELSE
    recommendation_percentage := NULL;
  END IF;
  
  RETURN json_build_object(
    'total_reviews', total_reviews,
    'recommend_count', recommend_count,
    'not_recommend_count', not_recommend_count,
