# SynC ‚Äî Enhanced Unified Project Brief (Mermaid-Aligned v2.0)

**Version:** 2.0 ‚Ä¢ **Date:** September 17, 2025 ‚Ä¢ **Owner:** Umamahesh Madala

---

## 1) Vision & Problem

**Vision.** SynC connects city shoppers and hyperlocal businesses through a social, coupon-driven, "word-of-mouth at scale" experience, turning real in-store visits into measurable growth.

**Problem.** Physical stores can't push timely updates and struggle to stay connected between visits; users either miss offers or drown in irrelevant ads. SynC solves this with discovery, targeted offers, gamified sharing, and simple reviews that keep footfall high.

---

## 2) Users & Value

‚Ä¢ **Consumers:** discover businesses, collect/share coupons, redeem in store, and follow only what matches interests. Reviews are binary (üëç/üëé) with a short note.

‚Ä¢ **Merchants:** maintain storefronts, run coupons/ads, target "Drivers" (top advocates), and track analytics.

‚Ä¢ **Platform Owner (Command Centre):** manage users/merchants/content, pricing, promotions, and revenue via admin subdomain.
