# User Data Isolation Fix

## Issue Identified

The main issue was that favorites and recent search data were being saved in localStorage using global keys without differentiating users, leading to data crossover between test users.

**Problem Areas:**
1. **Favorites Data:** All users shared the same localStorage key `sync_unified_favorites`
2. **Recent Search Data:** All users shared the same localStorage key `recentSearches`  
3. **Search State:** All users shared the same localStorage keys `searchState` and `searchResults`

This caused User 1's favorited items and search history to appear for Users 2 and 3.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. User-Specific Favorites Storage

**File:** `src/hooks/useUnifiedFavorites.ts`

**Changes:**
- Updated storage key generation to include user ID:
  ```ts
  const getStorageKey = (userId?: string) => {
    return userId ? `sync_unified_favorites_${userId}` : 'sync_unified_favorites_guest';
  };
  ```
- Modified all localStorage operations to use user-scoped keys
- Added user change detection to reload favorites when switching users
- Updated all save/load operations to pass user ID

### 2. User-Specific Recent Searches

**File:** `src/components/Search.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated recent search key generation:
  ```ts
  const recentSearchKey = user?.id ? `recentSearches_${user.id}` : 'recentSearches_guest'
  ```
- Added effect to reload recent searches when user changes
- Updated all localStorage operations to use user-scoped keys

### 3. User-Specific Search State

**File:** `src/hooks/useSearch.ts`

**Changes:**
- Updated search state and results key generation:
  ```ts
  const searchStateKey = user?.id ? `searchState_${user.id}` : 'searchState_guest';
  const searchResultsKey = user?.id ? `searchResults_${user.id}` : 'searchResults_guest';
  ```
- Added effect to reload search state when user changes
- Updated all localStorage persistence to use user-scoped keys

## Key Features of the Fix

1. **User Isolation:** Each user now has completely separate localStorage data
2. **Guest Support:** Unauthenticated users get a "guest" namespace
3. **Automatic Migration:** When users switch, their data is automatically loaded
4. **Backward Compatibility:** Existing data structure is preserved, just scoped to users
5. **Cross-Component Sync:** All components using favorites still sync properly within the same user

## localStorage Keys After Fix

**Before (Global):**
- `sync_unified_favorites`
- `recentSearches`
- `searchState`
- `searchResults`

**After (User-Scoped):**
- `sync_unified_favorites_${userId}` or `sync_unified_favorites_guest`
- `recentSearches_${userId}` or `recentSearches_guest`
- `searchState_${userId}` or `searchState_guest`
- `searchResults_${userId}` or `searchResults_guest`

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. **Login as User 1:** Add favorites and perform searches
2. **Login as User 2:** Verify no favorites/searches from User 1 appear
3. **Switch back to User 1:** Verify User 1's data is restored
4. **Guest User:** Verify guest users have separate data namespace

## Impact

- ✅ **Data Isolation:** Each user now has completely separate data
- ✅ **Performance:** No performance impact, same localStorage operations
- ✅ **UX:** Smooth user switching with proper data restoration  
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility:** Existing code continues to work
- ✅ **Security:** User data cannot be accessed by other users

## Files Modified

1. `src/hooks/useUnifiedFavorites.ts` - User-scoped favorites storage
2. `src/components/Search.tsx` - User-scoped recent searches
3. `src/hooks/useSearch.ts` - User-scoped search state and results

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing server-side sync for true cross-device data persistence
- Monitor localStorage usage as user count grows
- Consider data cleanup for guest users after extended periods
