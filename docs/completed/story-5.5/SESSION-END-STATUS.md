# Session End Status - Story 5.5 Wallet & Sharing

## Date: 2025-10-02

## Issues Reported by User

### 1. ❌ COLLECT BUTTON STATE NOT REFLECTING ACTUAL STATUS
**Status: PARTIALLY FIXED - NEEDS TESTING**

**Problem:**
- Collect button on search page doesn't show correct state
- Should show "Saved" if already collected, "Collect" if not
- State doesn't update after reload/refresh

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/hooks/useSearch.ts` (lines 315-338)
- Added database query to fetch user's collected coupons
- Changed hardcoded `isCollected: false` to `isCollected: userCollectedCouponIds.has(coupon.id)`
- Updated `handleCollectCoupon` to update local state after collection

**Still Needs:**
- Verification that the fix actually works
- May need to add real-time subscription to user_coupon_collections table
- Consider adding a refresh mechanism after collection

### 2. ❌ COUPON CARDS OVERFLOWING BOUNDARIES
**Status: ATTEMPTED FIX - NOT VERIFIED**

**Problem:**
- Coupon cards in wallet page overflow their grid container
- Text extends beyond card boundaries
- Cards don't fit properly in grid

**Changes Made:**
- Added `w-full max-w-full` to card container (line 380)
- Added `overflow-hidden` to card content div (line 440)
- Added `break-words` to description text (line 454)
- Added `truncate` to business name (line 459)
- Added `w-full` and `auto-rows-fr` to grid (lines 802-804)
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to icons
- Added `min-w-0` to parent containers

**Still Needs:**
- Actual verification that overflow is fixed
- May need additional CSS constraints
- Consider using CSS Grid `minmax()` for better responsive behavior

## Files Modified in This Session

1. `src/components/user/CouponWallet.tsx`
   - Fixed hook import from `useCoupons` to `useUserCoupons`
   - Added optional chaining for `coupon.category`
   - Added width and overflow constraints

2. `src/components/Sharing/SharingStatsCard.tsx`
   - Added null check for stats prop (line 27)

3. `src/components/Sharing/ShareCouponModal.tsx`
   - Fixed SharingStatsCard to pass `stats` prop (line 241-245)

4. `src/hooks/useSearch.ts`
   - Added user collection check in `performSearch` (lines 315-338)

5. `src/services/couponService.ts`
   - Already had `getUserCollectedCoupons` function (no changes needed)

## SQL Issues Fixed Earlier

- Fixed `ADD-TEST-COUPON-FOR-USER2.sql` to include required fields:
  - `coupon_code`
  - `created_by`
  - `expires_at` in user_coupon_collections

## Known Issues NOT Fixed

1. **Share button navigation error** - Fixed
2. **Wallet loading "Failed to load coupons" error** - Fixed
3. **Missing functions in couponService** - Fixed

## Recommendations for Next Session

### High Priority
1. **Test collect button state thoroughly:**
   ```bash
   # Steps to test:
   # 1. Log in as Test User 2
   # 2. Go to search page
   # 3. Find a coupon
   # 4. Click "Collect"
   # 5. Reload page - button should show "Saved"
   # 6. Go to wallet - coupon should appear
   ```

2. **Verify overflow fixes:**
   - Check wallet page at different screen sizes
   - Verify cards stay within boundaries
   - Test with long text in titles/descriptions

3. **Add comprehensive logging:**
   ```typescript
   // In useSearch.ts performSearch
   console.log('User collected coupons:', Array.from(userCollectedCouponIds));
   console.log('Coupon isCollected states:', result.coupons.map(c => ({
     id: c.id,
     title: c.title,
     isCollected: c.isCollected
   })));
   ```

### Medium Priority
1. Add real-time updates for collect button state
2. Implement proper loading states
3. Add error boundaries for better error handling
4. Consider caching user collections for performance

### Code Quality Improvements Needed
1. Better TypeScript types for search results
2. Consistent error handling across components
3. More defensive programming (null checks, fallbacks)
4. Better separation of concerns
5. Add unit tests for critical functions

## Testing Checklist for Next Session

- [ ] Collect button shows correct initial state
- [ ] Collect button updates after collection
- [ ] Collect button state persists after refresh
- [ ] Collected coupons appear in wallet
- [ ] Cards don't overflow in wallet grid
- [ ] Text truncates properly in cards
- [ ] Share modal opens without errors
- [ ] Share functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior is correct

## Notes

The main issue is that fixes were applied without proper testing verification. The code changes look correct in theory, but without running the app and testing, there's no guarantee they work as expected.

**Lesson learned:** Always verify fixes with actual testing, not just code review.
