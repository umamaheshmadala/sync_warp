# üéâ Story 5.5: Final Testing Guide - Updated Architecture

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

All 4 critical issues are now resolved:

1. ‚úÖ **One-share-per-instance** - Same coupon can only be shared once
2. ‚úÖ **Wallet transfer** - Coupon moves from sender to receiver
3. ‚úÖ **Lifecycle tracking** - Complete audit trail
4. ‚úÖ **Wallet filtering** - Filter by collected vs. received

---

## üöÄ Testing the Updated System

### Step 1: Add a Coupon to Your Wallet

**Option A: Quick Add (Automatic)**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO user_coupon_collections (
  user_id, coupon_id, acquisition_method, is_shareable, 
  has_been_shared, collected_at, expires_at, status, collected_from
)
SELECT 
  (SELECT auth.uid()), id, 'collected', TRUE, FALSE, NOW(),
  valid_until, 'active', 'direct_search'
FROM business_coupons
WHERE status = 'active' AND valid_until > NOW()
LIMIT 1;
```

**Option B: Choose Specific Coupon**
1. Get coupon IDs: `SELECT id, title FROM business_coupons WHERE status = 'active' LIMIT 5;`
2. Run the SQL in `docs/story-5.5/ADD-COUPON-TO-WALLET.sql` with your chosen coupon ID

---

### Step 2: Open the Test Page

Go to: `http://localhost:3000/test-sharing-limits`

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Stats card showing your limits
- ‚úÖ **"Your Shareable Coupons"** section with the coupon you just added

---

### Step 3: Test Sharing

1. **Click on a coupon** in the wallet (it will highlight blue with a checkmark)

2. **Get a friend ID:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email FROM auth.users LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Paste the friend ID** in the "Friend ID" field

4. **Click "Check Permission"**
   - Should show: "‚úÖ Can share! X shares remaining today"

5. **Click "Log Share"**
   - Should show: "‚úÖ Share logged successfully! Coupon removed from your wallet and added to friend's wallet"
   - **Coupon disappears from your wallet list**
   - Stats update automatically

---

### Step 4: Verify Wallet Transfer

**Check your wallet (sender):**
```sql
SELECT 
  id, coupon_id, status, has_been_shared, shared_to_user_id, shared_at
FROM user_coupon_collections
WHERE user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())
ORDER BY collected_at DESC;
```

You should see:
- `status = 'used'`
- `has_been_shared = true`
- `shared_to_user_id = <friend-uuid>`

**Check friend's wallet (receiver):**
```sql
SELECT 
  id, coupon_id, acquisition_method, original_owner_id, status
FROM user_coupon_collections
WHERE user_id = 'FRIEND-UUID-HERE'
AND coupon_id = 'COUPON-UUID-HERE';
```

You should see:
- NEW ROW created
- `acquisition_method = 'shared_received'`
- `original_owner_id = <your-uuid>`
- `status = 'active'`

---

### Step 5: Test One-Share-Per-Instance

1. Try to add the same coupon to your wallet again (use the SQL from Step 1)
2. Refresh the test page
3. Try to share it again
4. ‚ùå It won't appear in your shareable coupons list anymore!

---

### Step 6: View Lifecycle History

**Check lifecycle events:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_coupon_lifecycle('COUPON-UUID-HERE', null);
```

You should see:
- `event_type = 'collected'` (when you collected it)
- `event_type = 'shared_sent'` (when you shared it)
- `event_type = 'shared_received'` (when friend received it)

---

## üß™ Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multiple Shares (Different Instances)
```sql
-- Add 3 different coupons to your wallet
INSERT INTO user_coupon_collections (user_id, coupon_id, expires_at, status)
SELECT (SELECT auth.uid()), id, valid_until, 'active'
FROM business_coupons
WHERE status = 'active'
LIMIT 3;

-- Refresh test page
-- Share each coupon to different friends
-- ‚úÖ Each should work fine (different instances)
```

### Scenario 2: Share Chain (Re-sharing)
```sql
-- User 1 shares to User 2
-- User 2 can then share to User 3!

-- As User 2, check your wallet
SELECT * FROM get_shareable_coupons((SELECT auth.uid()));

-- The received coupon should appear (is_shareable = TRUE)
-- Share it to User 3 using the test page
-- ‚úÖ Creates complete sharing chain
```

### Scenario 3: Limit Testing
```sql
-- Share to same friend 3 times (different coupons)
-- On 4th attempt: ‚ùå "Daily limit to this friend reached"

-- Share to 20 different friends (20 different coupons)
-- On 21st attempt: ‚ùå "Daily sharing limit reached"
```

## üìä Monitoring & Debugging

### View All Lifecycle Events
```sql
SELECT 
  cle.event_type,
  cle.event_timestamp,
  u1.email as user_email,
  u2.email as related_user_email,
  bc.title as coupon_title
FROM coupon_lifecycle_events cle
JOIN auth.users u1 ON u1.id = cle.user_id
LEFT JOIN auth.users u2 ON u2.id = cle.related_user_id
JOIN business_coupons bc ON bc.id = cle.coupon_id
WHERE cle.event_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY cle.event_timestamp DESC;
```

### View Sharing Analytics
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email as sender,
  COUNT(*) as total_shares,
  COUNT(DISTINCT recipient_id) as unique_recipients,
  MAX(shared_at) as last_share
FROM coupon_sharing_log csl
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = csl.sender_id
WHERE sharing_day = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY u.email
ORDER BY total_shares DESC;
```

### Check Wallet Status
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE acquisition_method = 'collected') as collected,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE acquisition_method = 'shared_received') as received,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE has_been_shared = TRUE) as shared_away,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active') as active
FROM user_coupon_collections ucc
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = ucc.user_id
GROUP BY u.email;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No shareable coupons in your wallet"
**Solution:** Add a coupon using the SQL in Step 1

### "Invalid collection: already shared"
**Solution:** This is correct! You're trying to share a coupon that was already shared. Refresh the page to see updated wallet.

### Coupon doesn't disappear after sharing
**Solution:** 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify migration ran successfully (`docs/story-5.5/VERIFY-MIGRATION.sql`)
- Check `has_been_shared` flag in database

### Friend doesn't receive coupon
**Solution:**
- Check `coupon_sharing_log` table for the share entry
- Check `user_coupon_collections` for receiver's new entry
- Check lifecycle events table
