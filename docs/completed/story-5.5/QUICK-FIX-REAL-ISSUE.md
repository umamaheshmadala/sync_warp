# üéØ FOUND THE REAL PROBLEM!

## What the Console Shows

‚úÖ **User is authenticated** (User ID: eed7a6f3-f531-4621-a118-756cd5d694c4)  
‚úÖ **Session is valid** (access_token present)  
‚ùå **ERROR**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "coupon_lifecycle_events"`

## The REAL Problem

The error is **NOT** about `user_coupon_collections`! It's about `coupon_lifecycle_events`.

When you collect a coupon, there's a trigger that tries to log the event to `coupon_lifecycle_events` table, but that table has **no INSERT policy**.

## The Fix (2 Minutes)

### Run This SQL Script

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```sql
-- File: docs/story-5.5/FIX-LIFECYCLE-EVENTS-RLS.sql
```

This adds the missing INSERT policy to `coupon_lifecycle_events`.

### Then Test Immediately

1. Go to your application
2. Search for a coupon
3. Click "Collect"
4. Should work now! ‚úÖ

## Why This Happened

1. Migration added `coupon_lifecycle_events` table with RLS enabled
2. Migration created a SELECT policy but **forgot the INSERT policy**
3. Trigger tries to insert when you collect ‚Üí Permission denied
4. We fixed the wrong table first üòÖ

## Expected Result

After running the fix script:
- ‚úÖ "Coupon collected successfully!"
- ‚úÖ No more permission errors
- ‚úÖ Coupon appears in your wallet

**TL;DR**: Run `FIX-LIFECYCLE-EVENTS-RLS.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor, then test!
