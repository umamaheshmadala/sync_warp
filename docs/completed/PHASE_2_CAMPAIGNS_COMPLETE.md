## üìù Usage Examples

### Driver Service:

```typescript
import { driverService } from '@/services';

// Get current user's driver profile
const profile = await driverService.getMyDriverProfile(cityId);

// Check driver status
const isDriver = await driverService.isUserDriver(userId, cityId);

// Get top 10 drivers in city
const topDrivers = await driverService.getTopDrivers(cityId, 10);

// Refresh driver profile after activity
const updated = await driverService.refreshDriverProfile(userId, cityId);

// Get driver statistics
const stats = await driverService.getDriverStats(cityId);
// Returns: { total_users, driver_count, driver_percentage, avg_score, ... }

// Get driver badge
const badge = driverService.getDriverBadgeForProfile(profile);
// Returns: { is_driver, percentile, badge_color, badge_label }
```

### Targeting Service:

```typescript
import { targetingService } from '@/services';

// Estimate audience reach
const estimate = await targetingService.estimateAudienceReach({
  targeting_rules: {
    age_ranges: ['25-34', '35-44'],
    interests: ['food_dining'],
    drivers_only: true
  },
  city_id: cityId
});
// Returns: { total_reach, drivers_count, breakdowns, confidence_level }

// Validate targeting
