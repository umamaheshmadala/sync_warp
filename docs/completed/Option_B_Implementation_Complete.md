### 2. BusinessRegistration.tsx Updates ✅
**File:** `src/components/business/BusinessRegistration.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added import for `RegistrationCompleteScreen`
- ✅ Added state variables:
  - `showCompletionScreen` (boolean)
  - `registeredBusinessId` (string | null)
- ✅ Modified `handleSubmit` function:
  - Now retrieves `id` from inserted business
  - Sets `registeredBusinessId` state
  - Sets `showCompletionScreen` to true
  - Instead of navigating directly to dashboard
- ✅ Added conditional rendering:
  - Shows `RegistrationCompleteScreen` if success
  - Otherwise shows normal registration form

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// New state
const [showCompletionScreen, setShowCompletionScreen] = useState(false);
const [registeredBusinessId, setRegisteredBusinessId] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Updated database insert
const { data: newBusiness, error } = await supabase
  .from('businesses')
  .insert([businessData])
  .select('id')  // ← Get ID back
  .single();

// Show transition screen
setRegisteredBusinessId(newBusiness.id);
setShowCompletionScreen(true);

// Conditional render
if (showCompletionScreen && registeredBusinessId) {
  return <RegistrationCompleteScreen ... />;
}
```

### 3. OnboardingReminderBanner Component ✅
**File:** `src/components/business/OnboardingReminderBanner.tsx` (172 lines)

**Features:**
- ✅ Checks onboarding completion status
- ✅ Shows only if onboarding NOT complete
- ✅ Beautiful gradient design matching completion screen
- ✅ Two dismiss options:
  - Temp dismiss (session storage) - shows again in new session
  - Permanent dismiss (local storage) - never shows again
- ✅ Action buttons:
  - "Complete Profile (15 min)" → Onboarding
  - "Remind Me Later" → Temp dismiss
  - X button → Permanent dismiss
- ✅ Shows 3 benefits with checkmarks
- ✅ Progress bar showing 20% completion
- ✅ Smooth fade in/out animations

**Logic:**
```typescript
// Check if completed
const isComplete = !!business?.onboarding_completed_at;

// Check if dismissed
const dismissed = localStorage.getItem(`onboarding_dismissed_${businessId}`);
const tempDismissed = sessionStorage.getItem(`onboarding_temp_dismissed_${businessId}`);

// Show only if: not complete AND not dismissed
if (!isComplete && !dismissed && !tempDismissed) {
  show banner
}
```

)}

{/* Statistics */}
