   - You'll be redirected to `/checkins?business={businessId}`
   - The check-in page will automatically detect the business
   - Follow the check-in process to earn rewards

## Technical Implementation

### URL Structure
- Generated QR codes contain: `${window.location.origin}/checkins?business=${businessId}`
- This directs users to the check-in page with the business pre-selected

### File Naming
- Downloaded files use format: `{business-name}-qr-code.png`
- Special characters in business names are handled appropriately

### Canvas Enhancement
When business info or logo is enabled:
- QR code is drawn on HTML5 canvas
- Business name and type are rendered above the QR code
- Logo is embedded in the center with white background circle
- Canvas size adjusts automatically to accommodate enhancements

### Performance
- QR codes are generated client-side using the `qrcode` library
- No server requests needed for QR code generation
- Instant preview updates when customization options change

## Best Practices

### QR Code Placement
- Place at customer eye level (3-4 feet high)
- Ensure good lighting for easy scanning
- Avoid reflective surfaces or areas with glare
- Keep the QR code clean and unobstructed

### Size Guidelines
- **Small (200-300px)**: Table tents, business cards
- **Medium (400-500px)**: Wall displays, posters
- **Large (600-800px)**: Window displays, large signage

### Color Selection
- **High Contrast**: Dark foreground on light background works best
- **Avoid**: Low contrast combinations, similar colors
- **Test**: Always test scanning before final deployment

### Error Correction
- **Low**: Perfect printing conditions, digital displays
- **Medium**: Standard paper printing, most common use
- **Quartile**: Outdoor use, potential wear and tear
- **High**: Small sizes, harsh environments, critical applications

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Won't Scan
1. Check contrast between foreground and background colors
2. Ensure QR code size is appropriate for viewing distance
3. Verify the QR code isn't damaged or obscured
4. Try increasing error correction level

### Download Issues
1. Ensure modern browser with download support
2. Check if pop-up blocker is preventing download
3. Try right-click "Save As" if direct download fails

### Print Quality
1. Use high-resolution settings (300+ DPI)
2. Choose appropriate paper type (matte works better than glossy)
3. Ensure printer has adequate ink/toner levels
4. Test scan the printed version before mass distribution
