## ❌ NOT STARTED - HIGH PRIORITY BLOCKERS

### Story 4B.1: Merchant Coupon Redemption Interface
**Status:** ❌ **NOT STARTED (0%)**  
**Priority:** 🔴 P0 - CRITICAL BLOCKER  
**Estimated Effort:** 5 days  
**Impact:** Blocking revenue generation and core platform functionality

#### Why This Is a Blocker
Without this story, merchants cannot:
- Validate coupons at point of sale
- Mark coupons as redeemed
- Track redemption analytics
- Complete the coupon lifecycle

This makes the entire coupon system **unusable for business owners** despite having creation and management features.

#### Required Implementation

**UI Components Needed:**
1. **Coupon Scanner Component** (QR/Barcode)
   - Camera integration for mobile
   - Manual code entry fallback
   - Real-time validation feedback

2. **Redemption Verification Screen**
   - Display coupon details
   - Show customer information
   - Confirm/reject interface
   - Success/error states

3. **Redemption History Dashboard**
   - List of redeemed coupons
   - Filter by date, customer, coupon type
   - Export functionality
   - Real-time updates

**Backend Requirements:**
- ✅ Database schema EXISTS (user_coupon_collections table)
- ❌ Redemption validation API endpoint
- ❌ QR code generation for coupons
- ❌ Redemption tracking and analytics
- ❌ Fraud prevention (usage limits, expiration)

**Technical Approach:**
```typescript
// Suggested implementation
POST /api/coupons/redeem
{
  couponId: string;
  collectionId: string;
  businessId: string;
  redemptionLocation?: {lat: number, lng: number};
}

Response:
{
  success: boolean;
  coupon: CouponDetails;
  customer: UserProfile;
  remainingUses: number;
  message: string;
}
```

#### Dependencies
- Requires Story 4B.6 (QR Code Generation) - but can use basic implementation
- Requires mobile-responsive design
- Requires camera permissions handling

POST /api/ads/reject     // Reject with reason
GET  /api/ads/stats      // Performance metrics
```

**Workflow States:**
```
draft → pending_approval → approved → active → completed
                         ↓
                      rejected

## 🎯 MVP Definition

### Minimum Viable Product (Quick Launch)
**Time Estimate: 2 weeks**

Must Have:
- ✅ Story 4B.3: Targeted Campaigns
- ✅ Story 4B.4: Enhanced Onboarding
- ❌ Story 4B.1: Merchant Redemption (BLOCKING MVP)
- ❌ Story 4B.6: QR Codes (enables redemption)

Can Defer:
- Story 4B.2: Ad Request (manual approval interim)
- Story 4B.5: Billing (invoice manually)
- Story 4B.7-9: Nice-to-have features

### Full Feature Complete
**Time Estimate: 5-6 weeks**

All 9 stories implemented with:
- Complete automation
- Admin interfaces
- Analytics dashboards
- Comprehensive testing

---

## 🚨 Risk Analysis

### Critical Risks

1. **Story 4B.1 Blocker**
   - **Risk:** Without redemption, coupons are unusable
   - **Impact:** HIGH - Platform value proposition broken
   - **Mitigation:** Prioritize immediately, allocate 5 days

2. **Payment Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Razorpay/Stripe integration issues
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM - Revenue delayed but platform functional
   - **Mitigation:** Use sandbox testing, have backup manual invoicing

3. **QR Code Dependencies**
   - **Risk:** Story 4B.1 depends on 4B.6
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM - Can use basic QR without styling
   - **Mitigation:** Implement minimal QR first, enhance later

### Technical Debt

**Current Issues:**
- TypeScript errors need cleanup (~200+ warnings)
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation for some features incomplete
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets

**Recommended Actions:**
- Allocate 2 days for TypeScript error cleanup
- Add integration tests for critical paths
- Performance profiling and optimization pass
