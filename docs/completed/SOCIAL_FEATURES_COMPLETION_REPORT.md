## 🚀 Major Achievement: Bidirectional Unfriend Fix

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: When User A unfriended User B, the friendship was only removed from User A's perspective
- **Impact**: User B still saw User A as a friend, causing data inconsistency
- **Criticality**: High - Core friendship functionality broken

### Solution Implemented
- **Database Function**: Created `public.remove_friend(UUID)` with proper bidirectional logic
- **Service Update**: Updated `newFriendService.removeFriend()` to use database function
- **Verification**: Comprehensive testing ensures both users see friendship removed
- **Documentation**: Complete fix guide and testing procedures created

### Technical Details
```sql
-- Database function ensures bidirectional removal
DELETE FROM public.friend_connections
WHERE status = 'accepted'
AND (
    (user_a_id = current_user_id AND user_b_id = friend_user_id) OR
    (user_a_id = friend_user_id AND user_b_id = current_user_id)
)
```

**Result**: ✅ Bidirectional unfriend now works perfectly - when any user unfriends another, the friendship is completely removed for both parties.
