## 🐛 Bugs Fixed During Testing

### Bug #1: Step 4 Continue Button Not Working
**Symptom:** Clicking Continue on Step 4 did nothing, no console errors  
**Root Cause:** Validation required non-existent `monthly_budget_cents` field  
**Fix:** Made Step 4 entirely optional in validation logic  
**File:** `src/types/business-onboarding.ts` (lines 688-691)

```typescript
case 4: // Marketing Goals (optional step)
  // Marketing goals are optional, no hard requirements
  // If user provides a primary goal, that's great, but not required to proceed
  break;
```

### Bug #2: Step 5 Complete Button Disabled
**Symptom:** Complete button greyed out on final step  
**Root Cause:** `canGoNext` was false on last step  
**Fix:** Changed logic to always allow next/complete  
**File:** `src/hooks/useOnboarding.ts` (line 403)

```typescript
// Allow "next" on all steps including the last one (for completion)
const canGoNext = true;
```
