## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Import Components

```tsx
// Campaign targeting
import { CampaignTargetingForm } from '@/components/campaign';

// Analytics
import { CampaignAnalyticsDashboard } from '@/components/campaign';
import { FollowerInsightsDashboard } from '@/components/business';

// Admin tools
import { FollowerActivityMonitor, SuspiciousActivityReviewer } from '@/components/admin';
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```tsx
// Campaign creation
<CampaignTargetingForm
  businessId={businessId}
  onTargetingChange={(targeting) => console.log(targeting)}
/>

// View analytics
<CampaignAnalyticsDashboard
  campaignId={campaignId}
  businessId={businessId}
/>

// Follower insights
<FollowerInsightsDashboard businessId={businessId} />
```

### 3. Database Setup

Run the SQL migrations to create required tables:
- `business_followers`
- `campaigns`
- `campaign_metrics`

See [QUICK_START_GUIDE.md](./QUICK_START_GUIDE.md) for complete SQL scripts.

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables

**business_followers**
- Tracks follower relationships
- Includes `is_active` for soft-delete unfollows
- Indexed on `business_id`, `user_id`, `is_active`

**campaigns**
- Stores campaign data
- `targeting_filters` (JSONB) stores demographic filters
- Statuses: draft, active, completed

**campaign_metrics**
- Tracks impressions, clicks, likes, shares
- Links to user and campaign
- Includes `is_follower` flag for segmentation

**users** (extended)
- Added: `age`, `gender`, `city` for demographics

## 🎨 UI Features

### Visual Elements
- 📊 Progress bars for demographic distributions
- 📈 Real-time reach estimation
- 🎯 Color-coded severity levels (admin)
- 📅 Time range selectors (7d, 30d, 90d)
- 💾 CSV export for analytics

### User Experience
- ⚡ Debounced calculations (500ms)
- 🔄 Loading states throughout
- ❌ Empty states with helpful messages
- ✅ Success/error toast notifications
- 🎨 Consistent Tailwind CSS styling

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debouncing**: Filter changes debounced to prevent excessive queries
- **Indexed Queries**: All foreign keys indexed for fast lookups
- **Client-side Aggregation**: Demographics calculated in-browser
- **Pagination Ready**: Components designed for future pagination

### Security
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security on all tables
- **Owner-based Access**: Users can only access their own data
- **Admin Controls**: Separate admin-only components
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized

### Data Flow
1. **Targeting**: Filters → Hook → Reach Calculation → UI Update
2. **Analytics**: Metrics Query → Aggregation → Visualization
3. **Monitoring**: Platform Data → Anomaly Detection → Alerts

## 📈 Metrics Tracked

### Campaign Metrics

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No followers showing**
- Verify database has follower records
- Check RLS policies allow reading
- Ensure `is_active = true`

**Reach estimate is 0**
- Add test data to database
- Verify users have demographic info
- Check filter constraints aren't too restrictive

**Analytics not loading**
- Confirm campaign has metrics data
- Verify campaign_id is valid UUID
- Check user permissions
