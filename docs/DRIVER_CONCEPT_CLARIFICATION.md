# Driver Concept Clarification - SynC App

## üö® Critical Clarification Required

### The Misconception
The initial seeding and campaign scripts incorrectly assumed "Drivers" referred to **taxi/rideshare drivers**.

### The Reality
**"Drivers"** in SynC are:

## ‚úÖ Correct Definition: POWER USERS

### "Drivers" = Top 10% Most Active Users Per City

They are called "Drivers" because they **DRIVE**:
1. üöÄ **Word-of-mouth marketing** through coupon sharing
2. üë• **Viral growth** through social engagement
3. üè™ **Footfall** to local businesses
4. üí¨ **Community buzz** through reviews and check-ins

---

## How "Driver" Status is Earned

Users become "Drivers" by ranking in the **top 10% by activity score** in their city.

### Activity Scoring Formula

| Activity Type | Default Weight | What It Measures |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Coupon Sharing** | 30% | Sharing coupons with friends |
| **Coupon Collecting** | 20% | Discovering and collecting offers |
| **Check-ins** | 15% | Visiting businesses physically |
| **Coupon Redemption** | 15% | Actually using collected coupons |
| **Reviews** | 10% | Writing recommendations (üëç/üëé) |
| **Social Interactions** | 10% | Friend connections, activity feed |

**Total:** 100% (configurable by admin)

## Example Driver Profile

```
User: Rahul Sharma
City: Mumbai  
Activity Score: 8,247 points
City Rank: #127 out of 12,450 users
Percentile: 99.0% ‚Üí ‚úÖ Driver Status (Top 10%)

Activity Breakdown:
‚îú‚îÄ Coupons Collected: 234
‚îú‚îÄ Coupons Shared: 567 (2.4x multiplier!)
‚îú‚îÄ Check-ins: 78 businesses
‚îú‚îÄ Coupons Redeemed: 189
‚îú‚îÄ Reviews Written: 42
‚îî‚îÄ Friend Connections: 89

Value to Merchants:
‚Üí Shares MORE than he collects (viral amplification)
‚Üí Actually visits businesses (drives footfall)
‚Üí Active reviewer (builds trust & social proof)
‚Üí Large friend network (reach multiplier)
```

---

## Business Value

### Why Merchants Target "Drivers"

Targeting "Drivers" means reaching:

‚úÖ **Local Influencers** - Top 10% have the largest friend networks  
‚úÖ **Early Adopters** - They try new businesses first  
‚úÖ **Advocates** - They actively share and recommend  
‚úÖ **Proven Engagers** - High activity = high conversion potential  

### ROI Multiplier

Regular User: 1 person sees offer ‚Üí maybe 1 redemption  
**Driver**: 1 person sees offer ‚Üí shares to 5-10 friends ‚Üí 3-5 redemptions ‚Üí viral loop

## Campaign Targeting Options

### Option 1: All Users
```json
{
  "behavior": {
    "drivers_only": false,
    "min_activity_score": 0
  }
}
```
- Broadest reach
- Good for awareness
- Lower engagement

### Option 2: High-Activity Users
```json
{
  "behavior": {
    "drivers_only": false,
    "min_activity_score": 3000
  }
}
```
- Active users (not necessarily top 10%)
- Balance of reach + engagement

### Option 3: Drivers Only (Premium)
```json
{
  "behavior": {
    "drivers_only": true,
    "min_activity_score": 3000
  }
}
```
- Top 10% power users only
- Highest engagement
- Maximum viral potential
- Premium targeting option

## Database Schema

### `driver_profiles` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE driver_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  city_id UUID REFERENCES cities(id),
  
  -- Activity Scores
  total_activity_score NUMERIC,
  coupons_collected_score NUMERIC,
  coupons_shared_score NUMERIC,
  coupons_redeemed_score NUMERIC,
  checkins_score NUMERIC,
  reviews_score NUMERIC,
  social_interactions_score NUMERIC,
  
  -- Rankings
  city_rank INTEGER,
  percentile NUMERIC,
  is_driver BOOLEAN,  -- TRUE if top 10%
  
  -- Activity Counts
  total_coupons_collected INTEGER,
  total_coupons_shared INTEGER,
  total_coupons_redeemed INTEGER,
  total_checkins INTEGER,
  total_reviews INTEGER,
  
  -- Metadata
  last_calculated_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Key Fields

- `is_driver`: **TRUE** if user is in top 10% of their city
- `total_activity_score`: Weighted sum of all activities
- `percentile`: User's rank percentile (90+ = Driver)
- `city_rank`: Absolute ranking within city

---

## Admin Configuration

Platform admins can configure the Driver algorithm via Command Centre:

```typescript
interface DriverAlgorithmConfig {
  // Weights (must sum to 100)
  coupons_collected_weight: 20,
  coupons_shared_weight: 30,      // Highest weight
  coupons_redeemed_weight: 15,
  checkins_weight: 15,
  reviews_weight: 10,
  social_interactions_weight: 10,
  
  // Thresholds
  driver_percentile_threshold: 90,  // Top 10%
  calculation_window_days: 90,      // Last 90 days
  min_activities_threshold: 10,     // Minimum 10 activities
  recency_decay_factor: 0.95        // Recent activity weighted higher
}
```
