‚úÖ **Issue 1**: Coupon collection working ‚Üí **FIXED**  
‚úÖ **Issue 2**: Appearing in wallet ‚Üí **FIXED**  
‚úÖ **Issue 3**: Sharing working ‚Üí **FIXED**  
üîß **Issue 4**: CSS overflow ‚Üí **FIXED in code**

üîß **Issue 6**: Collect button not reactivating ‚Üí **FIXED in code**  
üîß **Issue 7**: Shared coupon logic ‚Üí **FIXED in code**  

## Step 1: Fix Status Constraint (SQL)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- File: docs/story-5.5/FIX-REMAINING-ISSUES.sql
```

This adds `'deleted'` to the allowed status values.

## Step 2: Code Changes Made

### A. Fixed CSS Overflow Issues
- Added `overflow-hidden` to card container
- Fixed button layout with `flex-shrink-0`  
- Added responsive text truncation
- Better gap handling for buttons
- Added line-clamp utilities in `src/index.css`

### B. Fixed Coupon Collection Logic

**Before (Issues)**:
- Only checked for 'active' status
- Shared coupons could be re-collected
- Generic error messages

**After (Fixed)**:
```typescript
// Check for ANY existing collection (not just active)
.in('status', ['active', 'used', 'expired']) // Exclude deleted/removed

// Proper shared coupon handling
if (existingCollection.has_been_shared) {
  toast.error('This coupon was shared and cannot be collected again');
  return false;
}
```

### C. Fixed Double Toast Issue

The double toast was caused by:
1. Success toast: "Coupon removed from wallet" ‚úÖ
2. Error toast: Status constraint violation ‚ùå

After running the SQL fix, only success toast will show.

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Scenario 1: Normal Collection & Deletion
1. **Collect coupon** ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Coupon collected successfully!"
2. **Delete from wallet** ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Coupon removed from wallet" (single toast)
3. **Collect same coupon again** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success (can re-collect)

### Scenario 2: Shared Coupon Logic
1. **Collect coupon** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success
2. **Share with friend** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success
3. **Delete from wallet** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success  
4. **Try to collect again** ‚Üí ‚ùå "This coupon was shared and cannot be collected again"

### Scenario 3: CSS Overflow
1. **Long coupon titles** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Truncated with ellipsis
2. **Long descriptions** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Limited to 2 lines
3. **Button layout** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Proper spacing, no overflow
4. **Responsive** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works on mobile and desktop

## Files Changed

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Apply SQL Fix
```sql

```

### Step 2: Test Normal Flow

### Step 3: Test Shared Coupon Flow

### Step 4: Test CSS Fixes
1. Check coupon cards for overflow
2. Test on different screen sizes
3. Verify text truncation works
4. Check button layouts

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see double toasts:
- Check if SQL script was run successfully
- Verify constraint was updated: 
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_get_constraintdef(oid) FROM pg_constraint 
  WHERE conname = 'user_coupon_collections_status_check';
  ```

### If collect button doesn't reactivate:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the collection was marked as 'deleted' status
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### If CSS still overflows:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
- Check if index.css changes were applied
- Verify Tailwind is processing the new classes
