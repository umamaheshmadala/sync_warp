-- Fix RLS Policies for coupon_lifecycle_events table
-- This table is missing an INSERT policy, causing the Permission Denied error

-- Step 1: Check if table exists and RLS is enabled
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'coupon_lifecycle_events';

-- Step 2: List existing policies
SELECT 
  policyname,
  cmd as command_type,
  qual as using_expression
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'coupon_lifecycle_events'
ORDER BY cmd, policyname;

-- Step 3: Add missing INSERT policy
-- The trigger needs to be able to insert lifecycle events
CREATE POLICY "System can insert lifecycle events"
  ON coupon_lifecycle_events FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (TRUE);  -- Allow all inserts (system function)

-- Alternative: More restrictive policy (users can only insert their own events)
-- CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own lifecycle events"
--   ON coupon_lifecycle_events FOR INSERT
--   WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Step 4: Verify policies are now in place
SELECT 
  'coupon_lifecycle_events' as table_name,
  policyname,
  cmd as command_type,
  with_check as policy_expression
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'coupon_lifecycle_events'
ORDER BY cmd, policyname;

-- Step 5: Test that the fix works
-- This should now work without permission errors
