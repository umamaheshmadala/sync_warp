## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Component Hierarchy**
```
CouponWallet
  ├─ CouponWalletCard (multiple)
  │   └─ Share Button (conditional)
  │
  └─ ShareCouponModal (when showShareModal = true)
      ├─ Coupon Preview
      ├─ SharingStatsCard
      ├─ FriendSelector (step 1)
      ├─ Confirmation Screen (step 2)
      ├─ Loading Screen (step 3)
      ├─ Success Screen (step 4)
      ├─ Error Screen (step 4 alt)
      └─ LimitExceededModal (conditional)
```

### **Data Flow**
```
User clicks Share button
  ↓
CouponWallet.handleShareCoupon()
  ↓
Opens ShareCouponModal with:
  - couponId
  - collectionId
  - coupon object
  - currentUserId
  ↓
User selects friend in FriendSelector
  ↓
Confirmation screen shows
  ↓
User confirms
  ↓
shareWithValidation(friendId, couponId, collectionId)
  ↓
Database operations:
  - Mark sender's collection as "used"
  - Create receiver's collection
  - Log sharing event
  - Log lifecycle events
  ↓
Success callback:
  - Refresh wallet data
  - Refresh sharing stats
  - Close modal
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **New State Variables in CouponWallet**
```typescript
const {
  stats: sharingStats,
  limits: sharingLimits,
  loading: sharingLoading,
  canShareMore,
  refreshStats: refreshSharingStats
} = useSharingLimits();

const [showShareModal, setShowShareModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedCouponForShare, setSelectedCouponForShare] = useState<{
  couponId: string;
  collectionId: string;
  coupon: Coupon;
} | null>(null);
```

### **New Helper Functions**
```typescript
// Check if coupon can be shared
isCouponShareable(collection): boolean

// Handle share button click
handleShareCoupon(couponId, collectionId): void
```

### **New Filter Option**
```typescript
interface WalletFilters {
  // ... existing filters
  acquisition: 'all' | 'collected' | 'shared_received' | 'shareable';
}
```

### **New Wallet Stats**
```typescript
const walletStats = {
  // ... existing stats
  shareable: number,  // Count of shareable coupons
  shared: number      // Count of received coupons
}
```

## 🐛 Known Issues / Edge Cases

### **Issue 1: Profiles Table Schema**
**Problem:** The `profiles` table may not have `full_name` and `avatar_url` columns.

**Impact:** FriendSelector will show emails as names, and generated avatars with initials.

**Solution:** 
- Short term: Works fine with emails (already implemented)
- Long term: Add columns to profiles table:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN full_name TEXT;
  ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;
  ```

---

### **Issue 2: No Friends System**
**Problem:** Currently showing ALL users, not just friends.

**Impact:** Users can share with anyone in the system.

**Solution:**
- Phase 1: Current implementation (share with any user)
- Phase 2: Add friends/followers table
- Phase 3: Filter FriendSelector to only show friends

---

### **Issue 3: Real-time Updates**
**Problem:** If User B receives a coupon while their wallet is open, it won't appear until refresh.

**Impact:** Minor UX issue.

**Solution:**
- Add Supabase real-time subscriptions to wallet
- Listen for new `user_coupon_collections` inserts
- Auto-refresh or show notification

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

### **Design Decisions**
1. **Share Button Placement** - Right next to Redeem button for easy access
2. **Blue Theme** - Share button uses blue (gift/sharing color) vs green (redeem)
3. **Gift Icon** - Universal symbol for sharing/giving
4. **Multi-Step Flow** - Prevents accidental shares with confirmation
5. **Visual Feedback** - Loading spinners, success animations, clear error messages
6. **Limit Warnings** - Proactive display of limits before user hits them
7. **Inline Stats** - SharingStatsCard always visible in modal

### **Responsive Design**
- ✅ Modal is centered and scrollable
- ✅ Max width 2xl (672px)
- ✅ Max height 90vh
- ✅ Works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- ✅ Touch-friendly buttons

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

- Track: Unique sharers per day
