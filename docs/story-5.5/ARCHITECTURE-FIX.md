# üîß Story 5.5: Architecture Fix - Coupon Sharing

## üìã Overview

This document describes the architectural changes made to fix critical issues with coupon sharing:

1. ‚úÖ Enforce one-share-per-coupon-instance
2. ‚úÖ Implement wallet transfer on share
3. ‚úÖ Track complete coupon lifecycle
4. ‚úÖ Enable filtering/sorting of wallet coupons

---

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Multiple Shares of Same Coupon Instance
**Problem:** User 1 could share the same coupon to multiple users (User 2, User 3, etc.)

**Solution:**
- Added `has_been_shared` flag to `user_coupon_collections`
- Updated `log_coupon_share()` function to validate coupon hasn't been shared
- Marks coupon as "used" after sharing

### Issue 2: No Wallet Transfer
**Problem:** Sharing just logged an event‚Äîcoupon stayed in sender's wallet

**Solution:**
- Sharing now removes coupon from sender's wallet (status ‚Üí 'used')
- Creates new collection entry in receiver's wallet
- Links both via `sender_collection_id` and `receiver_collection_id`

### Issue 3: No Lifecycle Tracking
**Problem:** No comprehensive audit trail of coupon journey

**Solution:**
- Created `coupon_lifecycle_events` table
- Tracks all events: generated, collected, shared_sent, shared_received, redeemed, expired
- Auto-triggers on collection inserts

### Issue 4: Wallet Filtering/Sorting
**Problem:** Couldn't distinguish collected vs. received coupons

**Solution:**
- Added `acquisition_method` column: 'collected', 'shared_received', 'admin_granted', 'promotion'
- Added `original_owner_id` to track sharing chain
- Indexed for efficient filtering and sorting

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Columns in `user_coupon_collections`

```sql
- acquisition_method VARCHAR(50)     -- How coupon was obtained
- is_shareable BOOLEAN               -- Can be shared
- has_been_shared BOOLEAN            -- Already shared away
- shared_to_user_id UUID             -- Who it was shared to
- shared_at TIMESTAMP                -- When it was shared
- original_owner_id UUID             -- Original collector (if shared)
- sharing_log_id UUID                -- Link to sharing log
```

### New Columns in `coupon_sharing_log`

```sql
- sender_collection_id UUID          -- Sender's collection instance
- receiver_collection_id UUID        -- Receiver's collection instance
- notification_sent BOOLEAN          -- Notification status
- notification_sent_at TIMESTAMP     -- When notified
```

### New Table: `coupon_lifecycle_events`

```sql
CREATE TABLE coupon_lifecycle_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  coupon_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,   -- 'collected', 'shared_sent', etc.
  collection_id UUID,
  sharing_log_id UUID,
  redemption_id UUID,
  event_metadata JSONB,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  related_user_id UUID               -- For sharing events
);
```

---

## üîÑ Updated Functions

### 1. `log_coupon_share()` - Now Handles Wallet Transfer

**Before:**
```sql
log_coupon_share(sender_id, recipient_id, coupon_id, is_driver)
```

**After:**
```sql
log_coupon_share(sender_id, recipient_id, coupon_id, sender_collection_id, is_driver)
```

**What it does now:**
1. ‚úÖ Validates sender owns the collection
2. ‚úÖ Validates coupon hasn't been shared yet
3. ‚úÖ Marks sender's collection as "used"
4. ‚úÖ Creates new collection for receiver
5. ‚úÖ Links both collections in sharing_log
6. ‚úÖ Logs lifecycle events for both users
7. ‚úÖ Updates coupon collection count

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sharing_log_id": "uuid",
  "sender_collection_id": "uuid",
  "receiver_collection_id": "uuid",
  "message": "Coupon shared successfully"
}
```

### 2. `get_shareable_coupons()` - New Function

```sql
get_shareable_coupons(user_id)
```

Returns all coupons a user can share:
- Not already shared
- Status is 'active'
- Not expired
- Is shareable

**Returns:**
```sql
TABLE (
  collection_id UUID,
  coupon_id UUID,
  coupon_title VARCHAR,
  coupon_code VARCHAR,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  collected_at TIMESTAMP,
  acquisition_method VARCHAR
)
```

### 3. `get_coupon_lifecycle()` - New Function

```sql
get_coupon_lifecycle(coupon_id, user_id)
```

Returns complete audit trail for a coupon:
- All lifecycle events
- User emails involved
- Event metadata
- Chronological order

**Returns:**
```sql
TABLE (
  event_id UUID,
  event_type VARCHAR,
  user_id UUID,
  user_email VARCHAR,
  related_user_id UUID,
  related_user_email VARCHAR,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  event_metadata JSONB
)
```

## üìä Lifecycle Event Types

| Event Type | Description | Triggered When |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `generated` | Coupon created by business | Business creates coupon |
| `collected` | User collects from storefront | User saves to wallet |
| `shared_sent` | User shares to friend | Sender shares coupon |
| `shared_received` | User receives via share | Receiver gets coupon |
| `redeemed` | User redeems at business | Coupon used |
| `expired` | Coupon expires | Past valid_until date |
| `removed` | User removes from wallet | User deletes |
| `cancelled` | Business cancels coupon | Business admin action |

## üîê Updated Service Layer

### `sharingLimitsService.ts`

#### Updated Functions:

**`logCouponShare()` - Now requires collection_id**
```typescript
export async function logCouponShare(
  senderId: string,
  recipientId: string,
  couponId: string,
  senderCollectionId: string,  // NEW: Required
  isDriver: boolean = false
): Promise<any>
```

**`shareWithLimitValidation()` - Updated signature**
```typescript
export async function shareWithLimitValidation(
  recipientId: string,
  couponId: string,
  senderCollectionId: string  // NEW: Required
): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string }>
```

#### New Functions:

**`getShareableCoupons()` - Get user's shareable coupons**
```typescript
export async function getShareableCoupons(
  userId: string
): Promise<any[]>
```

**`getCouponLifecycle()` - Get coupon audit trail**
```typescript
export async function getCouponLifecycle(
  couponId: string,
  userId?: string
): Promise<any[]>
```

---

## üéØ How to Use (Updated Workflow)

### Old Workflow (Broken):
```typescript
// ‚ùå This would allow multiple shares of same instance
await shareWithLimitValidation(friendId, couponId);
```

### New Workflow (Fixed):
```typescript
// 1. Get user's shareable coupons
const shareableCoupons = await getShareableCoupons(userId);

// 2. User selects which coupon to share (from UI list)
const selectedCoupon = shareableCoupons[0];

// 3. Share with collection_id
await shareWithLimitValidation(
  friendId, 
  selectedCoupon.coupon_id,
  selectedCoupon.collection_id  // Ensures one-share-per-instance
);

// ‚úÖ This coupon is now removed from sender's wallet
// ‚úÖ This coupon now appears in receiver's wallet
// ‚úÖ Full audit trail recorded
```

---

## üì± UI Changes Required

### 1. Coupon Wallet View
**Add filtering:**
- All Coupons
- Collected (from businesses)
- Received (via sharing)
- Can Share (not yet shared)

**Add sorting:**
- Date collected (newest/oldest)
- Expiring soon
- By business
- By acquisition method

### 2. Share Flow
**Before sharing:**
1. Show list of shareable coupons (call `getShareableCoupons()`)
2. User selects coupon
3. User selects friend
4. Share button calls `shareWithLimitValidation()` with `collection_id`

**After sharing:**
- Coupon disappears from sender's "Can Share" list
- Moves to "Shared" section (with shared_to name/date)
- Receiver gets notification
- Receiver sees coupon in "Received" section

### 3. Coupon Details View
**Add lifecycle section:**
```typescript
const lifecycle = await getCouponLifecycle(couponId, userId);

// Show timeline:
// ‚îú‚îÄ Collected by you on Jan 1, 2025
// ‚îú‚îÄ Shared to John Doe on Jan 5, 2025
// ‚îî‚îÄ Redeemed by John Doe on Jan 10, 2025
```

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Test 1: One-Share-Per-Instance
```sql
-- 1. Get shareable coupons for User 1
SELECT * FROM get_shareable_coupons('user1-uuid');

-- 2. Share to User 2
SELECT log_coupon_share('user1-uuid', 'user2-uuid', 'coupon-uuid', 'collection1-uuid', false);

-- 3. Try to share same collection again (should fail)
SELECT log_coupon_share('user1-uuid', 'user3-uuid', 'coupon-uuid', 'collection1-uuid', false);
-- ‚ùå ERROR: Invalid collection: either not owned by sender, already shared, or not shareable
```

### Test 2: Wallet Transfer
```sql
-- Check User 1's wallet before share
SELECT * FROM user_coupon_collections WHERE user_id = 'user1-uuid' AND coupon_id = 'coupon-uuid';
-- status = 'active', has_been_shared = false

-- Share coupon
SELECT log_coupon_share('user1-uuid', 'user2-uuid', 'coupon-uuid', 'collection1-uuid', false);

-- Check User 1's wallet after share
SELECT * FROM user_coupon_collections WHERE user_id = 'user1-uuid' AND coupon_id = 'coupon-uuid';
-- status = 'used', has_been_shared = true, shared_to_user_id = 'user2-uuid'

-- Check User 2's wallet
SELECT * FROM user_coupon_collections WHERE user_id = 'user2-uuid' AND coupon_id = 'coupon-uuid';
-- NEW ROW: status = 'active', acquisition_method = 'shared_received', original_owner_id = 'user1-uuid'
```

### Test 3: Lifecycle Tracking
```sql
-- Get lifecycle for coupon
SELECT * FROM get_coupon_lifecycle('coupon-uuid', null);

-- Should show:
-- event_type = 'collected'        (User 1 collected)
-- event_type = 'shared_sent'      (User 1 sent to User 2)
-- event_type = 'shared_received'  (User 2 received)
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Run Migration:**
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL Editor
   -- Run: supabase/migrations/20251002000002_fix_coupon_sharing_architecture.sql
   ```

2. **Verify Migration:**
   ```sql
   -- Check new columns exist
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'user_coupon_collections' 
   AND column_name IN ('acquisition_method', 'has_been_shared', 'is_shareable');
   
   -- Check new table exists
   SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'coupon_lifecycle_events');
   
   -- Check functions updated
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_name IN ('log_coupon_share', 'get_shareable_coupons', 'get_coupon_lifecycle');
   ```

3. **Update Existing Data:**
   ```sql
   -- Set default values for existing coupons
   UPDATE user_coupon_collections
   SET 
     acquisition_method = 'collected',
     is_shareable = TRUE,
     has_been_shared = FALSE
   WHERE acquisition_method IS NULL;
   ```

4. **Update Frontend Code:**
   - Update sharing flow to use `getShareableCoupons()`
   - Pass `collection_id` to share functions
   - Add wallet filtering UI
   - Add lifecycle timeline view

5. **Test End-to-End:**
   - Collect a coupon
   - Share it to a friend
   - Verify it disappears from your wallet
   - Verify it appears in friend's wallet
   - Check lifecycle events
   - Try to share same instance again (should fail)

---

## üìù Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Old `log_coupon_share()` calls will fail (requires `collection_id` now)
- ‚úÖ Existing data is preserved
- ‚úÖ Migration sets sensible defaults for existing rows

### Performance
- ‚úÖ Indexed for fast queries
- ‚úÖ Lifecycle events don't slow down sharing
- ‚úÖ RLS policies restrict data access properly

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Notification service integration
- [ ] Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for sharing patterns
- [ ] Redemption tracking
- [ ] Coupon chaining (track full sharing chain)

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Invalid collection" Error
**Cause:** Collection ID doesn't exist, already shared, or not owned by sender

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Always get fresh list of shareable coupons
const shareableCoupons = await getShareableCoupons(userId);
// Only allow sharing from this list
```

### Coupon Still in Sender's Wallet After Share
**Cause:** Old code not using new architecture

**Solution:**
- Check you're calling updated `log_coupon_share()` with `collection_id`
- Verify migration ran successfully
- Check `has_been_shared` flag is set to `true`

### Lifecycle Events Not Appearing
**Cause:** Trigger not firing or RLS blocking access

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'trigger_log_collection_lifecycle';

-- Check RLS policy
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'coupon_lifecycle_events';
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All four issues are now fixed:

1. ‚úÖ Same coupon instance can only be shared once
2. ‚úÖ Sharing removes coupon from sender, adds to receiver
3. ‚úÖ Complete lifecycle is tracked and auditable
4. ‚úÖ Wallet can be filtered by acquisition method and sorted
