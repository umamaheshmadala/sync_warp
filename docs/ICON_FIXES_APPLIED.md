**Status**: ✅ All Issues Resolved

## 🐛 Issues Reported

### 1. Business card in search page showing heart icon instead of follow button ❌
**Problem**: Search BusinessCard was using `SimpleSaveButton` (heart icon) instead of proper `FollowButton` (user-plus icon)

### 2. Favorited products not stored/rendered properly ❌
**Problem**: Concern that products weren't being saved to `favorites` table or shown on FavoritesPage

### 3. Star icon clashing with 'Saved' banner on coupon cards ❌
**Problem**: Coupon cards had both a star collect button AND a 'Saved' banner, creating visual confusion

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Replace Heart with Follow Button in Search Results
**File**: `src/components/search/BusinessCard.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ❌ Removed: `SimpleSaveButton` import
- ✅ Added: `FollowButton` import from `../following/FollowButton`
- ✅ Replaced all `SimpleSaveButton` instances with `FollowButton`
- ✅ Updated props to use `businessId` and `businessName`
- ✅ Set appropriate variants: `ghost` (compact) and `outline` (featured)

**Result**: 
- Businesses in search now show 👥 UserPlus/UserCheck icon (indigo color)
- Properly calls `business_followers` table
- Shows "Follow"/"Following" states correctly

### Fix #2: Product Favorites Working Correctly
**Investigation Result**: ✅ No code changes needed - working as designed

**How It Works**:
1. ✅ `FavoriteProductButton` component exists and is integrated
2. ✅ `useFavoriteProduct` hook correctly saves to `favorites` table
3. ✅ `UnifiedFavoritesPage` uses `useFavoriteProducts` hook
4. ✅ `useFavoriteProducts` correctly queries `favorites` table for products
5. ✅ Real-time subscriptions are set up for instant updates

**Files Involved**:
- `src/components/products/FavoriteProductButton.tsx` - Button component ✅
- `src/hooks/useFavoriteProduct.ts` - Toggle favorite logic ✅
- `src/hooks/useFavoriteProducts.ts` - Fetch all favorites ✅
- `src/components/favorites/UnifiedFavoritesPage.tsx` - Display favorites ✅

**Database**:
- ✅ `favorites` table exists with correct schema
- ✅ RLS policies enabled
- ✅ Indexes created for performance

**Why it appeared broken**: 
- No products had been favorited yet (table was empty)
- Once you click the heart icon on any product, it will save and appear on Favorites page

### Fix #3: Remove Conflicting 'Saved' Banner from Coupons
**File**: `src/components/common/UnifiedCouponCard.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ❌ Removed: 'Saved' badge that appeared in top-right corner
- ✅ Kept: Star/Check icon from `CouponCollectButton` (shows collection state)

**Code Removed**:
```typescript
{/* Collected indicator */}
{coupon.isCollected && !showStatusBadge && !showCouponCount && (
  <div className="absolute top-3 right-3">
    <div className="bg-green-500 text-white px-2 py-1 rounded-full...">
      <Heart className="w-3 h-3 mr-1 fill-current" />
      Saved
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Result**:
- No more visual clash between badge and star icon
- Collection state is now ONLY shown via the star icon (⭐ uncollected → ✓ collected)
- Cleaner, less cluttered UI
