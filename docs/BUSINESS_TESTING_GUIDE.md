# Business Features Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

The business features are now implemented and ready for testing! Here's how to test them:

## 1. Setup Database (Required)

First, you need to set up the business tables in your Supabase database:

```bash
# Start Supabase locally (if using local instance)
npx supabase start

# Apply the business migration
npx supabase migration up
```

Or if using hosted Supabase, run the SQL migration file:
`supabase/migrations/20241201_create_business_tables.sql`

## 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server should start successfully and be available at `http://localhost:5175/` (or similar port).

## 3. Access Business Features

### From Dashboard:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard`
2. Look for the **Business Center** section
3. Click **"Register Your Business"** or **"Manage Businesses"**

### Direct URLs:
- **Business Registration**: `http://localhost:5175/business/register`
- **Business Dashboard**: `http://localhost:5175/business/dashboard`

## 4. Test Business Registration

### Step-by-Step Registration:

1. **Step 1: Basic Information**
   - Business Name (required)
   - Business Type (required)
   - Category (required) 
   - Description (required)
   - Business Email & Phone (optional)

2. **Step 2: Location & Contact**
   - Address (required)
   - City, State (required)
   - Postal Code (optional)
   - Click **"Get Location"** to auto-set coordinates
   - Website URL (optional)
   - Social Media links (optional)

3. **Step 3: Operating Hours**
   - Configure hours for each day
   - Toggle "Closed" for days off
   - Validation ensures open time < close time

4. **Step 4: Final Details**
   - Upload logo and cover images (optional)
   - Add tags for better discoverability
   - Review registration summary
   - Submit registration

## 5. Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Work:
- Form validation at each step
- Progress indicator showing current step
- Auto-geocoding when you click "Get Location"
- Image file selection (actual upload needs Supabase storage setup)
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Business status set to "pending" after registration
- Navigation between steps with Previous/Next buttons

### ⚠️ Known Limitations (Normal):
- Image uploads require Supabase storage bucket setup
- Business approval workflow not implemented (admin feature)
- No payment processing (not in scope)

## 6. Test Business Dashboard

After registering businesses:

1. Navigate to `/business/dashboard`
2. Should see grid of your registered businesses
3. Statistics cards showing totals
4. Each business card should show:
   - Business name and location
   - Status badge (pending/active)
   - Rating and review counts
   - View/Edit action buttons

## 7. Test Business Profile

1. Click "View" on any business in the dashboard
2. Should see business profile with tabs:
   - **Overview**: Business info, location, hours
   - **Statistics**: Performance metrics
3. If you own the business, click "Edit" to modify details

## 8. Common Issues & Solutions

### "Failed to load resource" errors:
- ✅ **Fixed**: Dependencies installed and TypeScript issues resolved

### Database connection errors:
- Ensure Supabase is configured with proper environment variables
- Run the migration to create business tables

### Form validation errors:
- All required fields marked with * must be filled
- Email must be valid format
- Website URL must include http/https

### Permission errors:
- Users can only see/edit their own businesses
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforced

## 9. Database Schema

The following tables are created:
- `business_categories` - Predefined categories (restaurants, retail, etc.)
- `businesses` - Main business profiles
- `business_products` - Products/services (future)
- `business_reviews` - Binary review system (future)
- `business_checkins` - GPS check-in system (future)

## 10. Next Steps for Development

Epic 4 remaining stories to implement:
- **Story 4.2**: Product/Service Catalog Management
- **Story 4.3**: Coupon Management with Merchant Redemption
- **Story 4.4**: Search & Discovery with Favorites/Wishlist
- **Story 4.6**: GPS Check-in System

Epic 5 integration:
- Binary review system (👍/👎)
- Social sharing of businesses
- Friend recommendations
