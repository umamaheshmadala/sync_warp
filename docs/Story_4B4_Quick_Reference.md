## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Check Onboarding Status
```sql
SELECT onboarding_completed_at 
FROM businesses 
WHERE id = '[business_id]';
```

### Check Progress
```sql
SELECT step_number, step_name, completed, data 
FROM business_onboarding_progress 
WHERE business_id = '[business_id]'
ORDER BY step_number;
```

### Check Saved Data
```sql
-- Customer profile
SELECT * FROM business_customer_profiles WHERE business_id = '[business_id]';

-- Metrics
SELECT * FROM business_metrics WHERE business_id = '[business_id]';

-- Goals
SELECT * FROM business_marketing_goals WHERE business_id = '[business_id]';
```

## 🎯 Common Issues

### "Button is disabled"
- Check if validation is failing (check console)
- Verify `canGoNext` returns true
- Ensure required fields are filled (Step 2 only)

### "Data not saving"
- Check network tab for API errors
- Verify business_id is valid
- Check Supabase auth token
- Look for validation errors in console

### "Can't proceed to next step"
- Verify validation passes
- Check if step is marked as completed
- Review `nextStep()` function logs
- Ensure no console errors
