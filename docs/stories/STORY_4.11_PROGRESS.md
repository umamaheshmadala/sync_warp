## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```
business_followers (renamed from favorites)
├── id (UUID, PK)
├── user_id (UUID, FK → profiles)
├── business_id (UUID, FK → businesses)
├── followed_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
├── notification_preferences (JSONB)
├── notification_channel (VARCHAR)
├── last_notified_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
└── is_active (BOOLEAN)

follower_updates
├── id (UUID, PK)
├── business_id (UUID, FK → businesses)
├── update_type (VARCHAR)
├── entity_id (UUID)
├── title (VARCHAR)
├── description (TEXT)
├── metadata (JSONB)
├── created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
└── is_active (BOOLEAN)

follower_notifications
├── id (UUID, PK)
├── user_id (UUID, FK → profiles)
├── business_id (UUID, FK → businesses)
├── update_id (UUID, FK → follower_updates)
├── notification_type (VARCHAR)
├── title (VARCHAR)
├── body (TEXT)
├── is_read (BOOLEAN)
├── is_sent (BOOLEAN)
└── created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

### Real-time Subscriptions
- ✅ `business_followers` - User's following list changes
- ✅ `follower_updates` - New content from followed businesses
- ✅ `follower_notifications` - New notifications with instant updates

### Data Flow
1. User follows business → Insert into `business_followers`
2. Business adds content → Trigger creates entry in `follower_updates`
3. Update trigger → Creates entries in `follower_notifications` for relevant followers
4. Real-time subscription → Notifies frontend of new updates
5. UI updates automatically → Shows notification badge/feed

---

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Zero Data Loss Approach
- ✅ All existing favorites preserved
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Gradual rollout possible
- ✅ Default notification preferences (all enabled)

### Coexistence Strategy
- Favorites system still works for coupons/products
- Following system dedicated to businesses
- Both can run in parallel during transition
- Easy rollback if needed

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 4):
1. Create `NotificationPreferencesModal` component
2. Build `FollowerFeed` with infinite scroll
3. Implement `FollowerNotificationBell` with badge
4. Connect all components together

### Short-term (Phase 5):
1. Build business owner dashboard
2. Create follower list with filtering
3. Add suspicious activity reporting
4. Integrate with campaign system

### Before Production:
1. Write comprehensive tests
2. Load test notification system
3. Security audit of RLS policies
4. Documentation for users
5. Migration guide for existing users
