## Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. **Immutability of Offers**
**Decision**: Offers cannot be edited after activation, must duplicate to edit.  
**Rationale**: Maintains audit trail and prevents confusion when users have shared old versions.

### 2. **No Redemption Tracking**
**Decision**: Offers are purely informational, no codes or redemption tracking.  
**Rationale**: Differentiates from coupons; simpler for businesses to manage.

### 3. **Highlight Duration**
**Decision**: Highlight shared offers for 5 seconds then clear.  
**Rationale**: Enough time to catch attention but not permanently distracting.

### 4. **Follow Prompt on Shared Links**
**Decision**: Show follow prompt to users who view shared offers but don't follow the business.  
**Rationale**: Drives follower growth and ensures users get future offer notifications.

### 5. **Storefront Integration as Tab**
**Decision**: Display offers as a separate tab on business profile, not inline with overview.  
**Rationale**: Keeps storefront organized; allows users to focus on offers when interested.
