## Date: 2025-01-24

## Overview
Updated the "View All" button behavior in the FeaturedOffers section to provide different experiences for business owners vs. regular users.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ User Experience (Non-Owners)
**Before**: Clicking "View All" opened a modal with all offers
**After**: Clicking "View All" navigates to the Offers tab with full filtering capabilities

**Rationale**: 
- Users want to see ALL offers, not just 4
- Offers tab provides search and filter functionality
- Better for browsing large numbers of offers
- Consistent with "View All" pattern used elsewhere in the app

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// In FeaturedOffers.tsx
onClick={isOwner ? handleViewAllOffers : () => navigate(`/business/${businessId}?tab=offers`)}
```

### 2. ✅ Business Owner Experience (Owners)
**Before**: Clicking "View All" opened a modal with all offers
**After**: Same - modal experience retained for owners

**Rationale**:
- Owners have "Manage Offers" button for full management
- Quick preview modal is useful for owners
- Doesn't disrupt their workflow
- Modal shows all offers without leaving Overview tab

### 3. ✅ URL Query Parameter Support
Added `?tab=offers` support to BusinessProfile component

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Handle direct tab navigation
if (tab && ['overview', 'offers', 'reviews', 'statistics', 'enhanced-profile'].includes(tab)) {
  setActiveTab(tab);
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Allows direct linking to specific tabs
- Works with offer highlight: `?tab=offers&offer=CODE`
- Provides predictable navigation behavior
- Enables bookmarking specific tabs

### 4. ✅ Consistent Card Click Behavior
Updated all CompactOfferCard clicks to use `?tab=offers&offer=CODE` format

**Locations Updated**:
1. FeaturedOffers main section cards
2. FeaturedOffers "View All" modal cards (for owners)

**Result**: 
- Clicking any offer card navigates to Offers tab
- Offer is highlighted for 5 seconds
- Smooth scroll to highlighted offer
- Consistent behavior across all entry points
