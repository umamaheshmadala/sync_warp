## ‚úÖ Critical Fixes Applied

### **Fix #1: Database Migration** ‚úÖ

### **Fix #2: Mock Data Removal** ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Discovery page showing dummy businesses instead of real data  
**Resolution:** Removed mock data fallbacks from `advancedSearchService.ts`  
**Changes:**
- Lines 154-159: Return empty results instead of mock businesses
- Lines 162-167: Return empty results on error instead of mock data
- Lines 473-478: Return empty array for suggestions instead of mock suggestions

**Impact:** Discovery page will now show:
- Real businesses from database
