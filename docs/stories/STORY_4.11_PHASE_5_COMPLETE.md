## Performance Considerations

1. **Follower List:**
   - Pagination recommended for 100+ followers
   - Current implementation loads all followers
   - Consider virtual scrolling for large lists

2. **Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Charts render efficiently with recharts
   - Data fetched once on mount
   - Real-time updates optional (via subscription)

3. **Report Modal:**
   - Light component (renders only when open)
   - Auto-closes after success
   - No memory leaks (proper cleanup)

---

## Security & Privacy

1. **RLS Policies:**
   - Business owners can only view their own followers
   - Business owners can only report their followers
   - Admins can view/manage all reports
   - Reported users cannot see reports about them

2. **Data Protection:**
   - No sensitive data exposed in frontend
   - All queries filtered by business ownership
   - Followers' personal data protected by existing RLS

3. **Report Abuse Prevention:**
   - Warning about false reports
   - Admin review required for all reports
   - Audit trail with timestamps
   - Reporter ID tracked for accountability
