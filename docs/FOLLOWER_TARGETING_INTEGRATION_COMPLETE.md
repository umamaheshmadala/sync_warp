## 📝 Code Examples

### Using Follower Metrics Widget
```tsx
import { FollowerMetricsWidget } from './FollowerMetricsWidget';

<FollowerMetricsWidget businessId={business.id} />
```

### Using Follower Targeting Editor  
```tsx
import { FollowerTargetingEditor } from '../campaign/FollowerTargetingEditor';

<FollowerTargetingEditor
  businessId={businessId}
  value={{
    targetFollowersOnly: true,
    engagementLevel: 'high',
    minFollowDays: 30,
    includeRecentFollowers: false
  }}
  onChange={(options) => {
    // Handle targeting changes
    console.log('New targeting options:', options);
  }}

```

### Querying Notifications
```sql
-- Get recent notifications for a user
SELECT 
  fn.*,
  b.business_name,
  fn.created_at
FROM follower_notifications fn

WHERE fn.user_id = 'user-uuid-here'
  AND fn.read_at IS NULL
ORDER BY fn.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Real-time Updates**: Using Supabase triggers provides instant notification delivery without cron jobs
2. **User Preferences**: Respecting notification preferences from day one prevents user fatigue
3. **Reach Estimation**: Client-side calculations are fast enough for real-time UI updates
4. **Component Reusability**: Follower targeting can be reused in multiple campaign types
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features work even when follower count is zero

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Notification Preferences**: Currently JSON in database, consider separate table for complex rules
2. **Reach Estimation**: Uses approximations; actual reach determined by database queries
3. **Batch Processing**: Large follower bases (1000+) may need async notification processing
4. **Rate Limiting**: Not yet implemented; could spam users if business creates many items quickly
